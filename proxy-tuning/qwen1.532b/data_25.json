      "Let's start by trying to find a pattern or a relationship using the given functional equation. We are given that $f(1) = 1.$ Let's plug in $x = y = 1$ into the equation to see what we get:\n\n\\[\nf(1) + f(1) = f(1 + 1) - 1 \\cdot 1 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n2f(1) = f(2) - 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 1 = f(2) - 2\n\\]\n\\[\nf(2) = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, let's try $x = 1$ and $y = 2$:\n\n\\[\nf(1) + f(2) = f(1 + 2) - 1 \\cdot 2 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n1 + 4 = f(3) - 3 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n5 = f(3) - 4\n\\]\n\\[\nf(3) = 9\n\\]\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging: $f(n) = n^2$ for the values we've tested. Let's try to prove this by induction. Assume that $f(k) = k^2$ for some integer $k \\geq 1.$ We want to show that $f(k + 1) = (k + 1)^2.$\n\nUsing the functional equation with $x = k$ and $y = 1$:\n\n\\[\nf(k) + f(1) = f(k + 1) - k \\cdot 1 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\nk^2 + 1 = f(k + 1) - k - 1\n\\]\n\\[\nf(k + 1) = k^2 + 1 + k + 1\n\\]\n\\[\nf(k + 1) = (k + 1)^2\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the pattern for $f(n) = n^2$ for all integers $n \\geq 1.$ Now, we need to check if this function satisfies the equation for all $x$ and $y.$\n\n\\[\nf(x) + f(y) = x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy - 1 = f(x + y) - xy - 1\n\\]\nThe last equality holds because $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ and $2xy - xy = xy.$ So, the function $f(n) = n^2$ satisfies the equation for all $x$ and $y.$\n\nNow, we need to find integers $n$ such that $f(n) = n.$ Since $f(n) = n^2,$ this means we need to find integers $n$ such that $n^2 = n.$ The only integer solutions to this equation are $n = 0$ and $n = 1.$\n\nTherefore, the integers $n$ for which $f(n) = n$ are $0$ and $1.$\n\n\\boxed{0, 1}"
