      "To find the values of $p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the $x^{n-1}$ term divided by the coefficient of the $x^n$ term, where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial.\n\nThe given polynomial is $x^8 + 3x^4 - 4$. The highest degree term is $x^8$ with a coefficient of 1, and the second-highest degree term is $3x^4$. The constant term is -4.\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas for the sum of the roots, we have:\n\nSum of roots of $x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = 0$ = $-\\frac{3}{1} = -3$\n\nSince the polynomial is given to be factored into monic polynomials with integer coefficients, the roots of these polynomials must come in conjugate pairs (because the polynomial is a sum of squares, and the sum of the roots of a quadratic with integer coefficients is an integer). Therefore, the sum of the roots of each factor will be an integer.\n\nLet's denote the roots of the polynomial as $r_1, r_2, ..., r_8$. Since the sum of all the roots is -3, we can write:\n\n$r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_8 = -3$\n\nNow, if we consider the sum of the values of the polynomials at $x = 1$, we have:\n\n$p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) = (1 - r_1) + (1 - r_2) + ... + (1 - r_8)$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) = 8 - (r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_8)$\n\nSince we know that $r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_8 = -3$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n$p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) = 8 - (-3) = 8 + 3 = 11$\n\nSo, the value of $p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1)$ is $11$. We can now put this in a box:\n\n\\boxed{11}"
