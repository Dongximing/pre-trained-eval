      "Since $z^5 = 1$, we know that $z$ is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation $x^5 - 1 = 0$. These roots are given by De Moivre's theorem as $z = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2k\\pi}{5}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{2k\\pi}{5}\\right)$, where $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ and $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nNow, we are looking for $z + \\frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2}$. We can rewrite this expression as:\n\n1. $z + \\frac{1}{z} = z + \\frac{1}{z} \\cdot \\frac{z^4}{z^4} = z + z^4$\n2. $z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} = z^2 + \\frac{1}{z^2} \\cdot \\frac{z^3}{z^3} = z^2 + z^3$\n\nWe know that $z^5 = 1$, so $z^4 = \\frac{1}{z}$ and $z^3 = \\frac{1}{z^2}$.\n\nNow, let's substitute these values:\n\n1. $z + z^4 = z + \\frac{1}{z} = 1$\n2. $z^2 + z^3 = z^2 + \\frac{1}{z}$ (since $z^3 = \\frac{1}{z^2}$)\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\n$1 + (z^2 + \\frac{1}{z})$\n\nSince $z^2 + \\frac{1}{z} = 1$ as well (because $z^2$ and $z^4$ are also fifth roots of unity and their sum with their reciprocals is 1), the entire expression becomes:\n\n$1 + 1 = 2$\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is $2$, and we can write the final answer in box form:\n\n\\boxed{2}"
