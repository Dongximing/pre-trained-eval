      "You have seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of gold coins. One day, you find a bag of 53 coins. You decide to redistribute the number of coins you have so that all eight bags you hold have the same number of coins. You successfully manage to redistribute all the coins, and you also note that you have more than 200 coins. What is the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins?"

      "Let's denote the number of gold coins in each of the original seven bags as \\( x \\). Since you found an additional bag with 53 coins, the total number of coins before redistribution was \\( 7x + 53 \\). After redistributing, you have eight bags with the same number of coins, so the total number of coins must be a multiple of 8. Let's call this multiple \\( y \\), where \\( y \\) is an integer greater than 200 (because you have more than 200 coins in total).\n\nSo we have the equation:\n\n\\[ 7x + 53 = 8y \\]\n\nWe want to find the smallest value of \\( x \\) that satisfies this equation and the condition that \\( 7x + 53 > 200 \\).\n\nLet's start by solving for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ 7x = 8y - 53 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{8y - 53}{7} \\]\n\nSince \\( y \\) is a multiple of 8, \\( 8y \\) will be a multiple of 56 (because 8 times 7 is 56). We need to find the smallest \\( y \\) such that \\( x \\) is an integer (because \\( x \\) represents the number of coins in each bag, and it must be a whole number).\n\nLet's start by finding the smallest \\( y \\) that makes \\( 8y - 53 \\) a multiple of 7. We can do this by adding 53 to multiples of 7 until we get a multiple of 8:\n\n1. \\( 7 \\times 1 + 53 = 60 \\) (not a multiple of 8)\n2. \\( 7 \\times 2 + 53 = 77 \\) (not a multiple of 8)\n3. \\( 7 \\times 3 + 53 = 90 \\) (not a multiple of 8)\n4. \\( 7 \\times 4 + 53 = 107 \\) (not a multiple of 8)\n5. \\( 7 \\times 5 + 53 = 120 \\) (not a multiple of 8)\n6. \\( 7 \\times 6 + 53 = 137 \\) (not a multiple of 8)\n7. \\( 7 \\times 7 + 53 = 150 \\) (not a multiple of 8)\n8. \\( 7 \\times 8 + 53 = 167 \\) (not a multiple of 8)\n9. \\( 7 \\times 9 + 53 = 184 \\) (not a multiple of 8)\n10. \\( 7 \\times 10 + 53 = 201 \\) (a multiple of 8)\n\nSo the smallest \\( y \\) that works is 10, because \\( 8 \\times 10 = 80 \\) and \\( 80 - 53 = 27 \\), which is a multiple of 7.\n\nNow we can find the smallest \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{8 \\times 10 - 53}{7} = \\frac{80 - 53}{7} = \\frac{27}{7} \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number because you can't have a fraction of a coin. Therefore, \\( x \\) is at least 4 (because \\( 27 \\div 7 = 3 \\) with a remainder, and you need to add one more coin to make it 4).\n\nSo the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins is \\( 7 \\times 4 = 28 \\) coins in each of the original seven bags.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{28}."
