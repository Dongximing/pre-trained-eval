      "Let's break down the expression step by step.\n\nGiven:\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{2.5^2 - 0.7^2}}{2.7 - 2.5}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the squares inside the square root:\n$$2.5^2 = (2.5) \\times (2.5) = 6.25$$\n$$0.7^2 = (0.7) \\times (0.7) = 0.49$$\n\nNow, subtract the second square from the first:\n$$6.25 - 0.49 = 5.76$$\n\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n$$2.7 - 2.5 = 0.2$$\n\nNow, take the square root of the result from the first step:\n$$\\sqrt{5.76}$$\nThe square root of 5.76 is approximately 2.4 (since \\(2.4 \\times 2.4 = 5.76\\) to two decimal places).\n\nNow, divide the square root by the denominator:\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{5.76}}{0.2}$$\n\nFinally, perform the division:\n$$\\frac{2.4}{0.2} = 12$$\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n$$\\boxed{12}$$"
