      "Given $f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$, what is the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value?"

    "answer": "1",
    "output": [
      "To find the smallest possible integer value for $x$ that makes $f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$ a real number, we need to consider two conditions:\n\n1. The expression inside the square root, $x - 1$, must be non-negative because the square root of a negative number is not a real number. Therefore, we have:\n   $$x - 1 \\geq 0$$\n   $$x \\geq 1$$\n\n2. The denominator, $x - 2$, cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. So $x$ cannot be 2.\n\nCombining these two conditions, we get:\n$$x \\geq 1 \\text{ and } x \\neq 2$$\n\nThe smallest integer value for $x$ that satisfies both conditions is $x = 2$ (because it's the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not equal to 2). However, since $x$ cannot be 2, we move to the next smallest integer, which is:\n\n$$x = 3$$\n\nSo, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $3$.\n\n$$\\boxed{x = 3}$$"
