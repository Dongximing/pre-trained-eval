      "To find the value of $c$ for the circle with the given equation, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle, which is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius. The equation given is:\n\n$$x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$$\n\nTo put it in the standard form, we complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms. \n\nFirst, let's complete the square for the $x$ terms:\n$$x^2 - 10x = (x^2 - 10x + 25) - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25$$\n\nNow, let's complete the square for the $y$ terms:\n$$y^2 + 6y = (y^2 + 6y + 9) - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9$$\n\nNow, substitute these back into the original equation:\n$$(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0$$\n\nRearrange the terms to get the standard form:\n$$(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 25 + 9 - c$$\n$$(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c$$\n\nSince we want the radius to be 1, we set the right side equal to $1^2 = 1$:\n$$(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 1$$\n\nNow, we can see that $34 - c = 1$, so we can solve for $c$:\n$$c = 34 - 1$$\n$$c = 33$$\n\nSo, the value of $c$ that will give the circle a radius of length 1 is $33$. Placing the answer in a box:\n\n\\boxed{33}"
