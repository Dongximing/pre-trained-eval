      "How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?"
    ],
    "answer": "9",
    "output": [
      "To find the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we can factorize 196 into its prime factors. \n\n196 can be expressed as:\n\n\\(196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\\)\n\nA number with prime factorization \\(p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^{a_n}\\) will have a total of \\((a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\ldots (a_n + 1)\\) divisors, including 1 and the number itself.\n\nFor 196, we have two prime factors, 2 and 7, with exponents 2 and 2, respectively. Applying the formula:\n\nNumber of divisors = \\((2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n\nSo, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors. The final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{9}"
