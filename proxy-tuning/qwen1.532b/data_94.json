      "To find the degree measure of angle $AFD$, we'll first determine the degree measure of angles $BAD$ and $CDA$ based on the given information.\n\nSince angle $BAD$ and $CDA$ are trisected, we can write:\n- Angle $BAD = 3x$ (because it's divided into 3 equal parts)\n- Angle $CDA = 3y$ (likewise, divided into 3 equal parts)\n\nWe are given that angle $BAD$ is $110^\\circ$ and angle $CDA$ is $100^\\circ$. Therefore:\n- $3x = 110^\\circ$\n- $3y = 100^\\circ$\n\nNow, we solve for $x$ and $y$:\n- $x = \\frac{110^\\circ}{3}$\n- $y = \\frac{100^\\circ}{3}$\n\nNext, we know that angle $ABE$ and $CDF$ are also trisected, which means $AEF$ is one-third of the sum of $BAD$ and $CDA$:\n- $AEF = \\frac{1}{3}(BAD + CDA)$\n- $AEF = \\frac{1}{3}(3x + 3y)$\n- $AEF = \\frac{1}{3}(110^\\circ + 100^\\circ)$\n- $AEF = \\frac{1}{3}(210^\\circ)$\n- $AEF = 70^\\circ$\n\nAngle $AFD$ is the exterior angle of triangle $ABE$, which is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles $ABE$ and $AEB$:\n- $AFD = ABE + AEB$\n- $AFD = 70^\\circ + x$ (since $AEB = x$ because $AEF$ is one-third of $BAD$)\n\nNow, substitute the value of $x$:\n- $AFD = 70^\\circ + \\frac{110^\\circ}{3}$\n\nTo get the final value, we add these two fractions:\n- $AFD = 70^\\circ + \\frac{110}{3}^\\circ = 70^\\circ + 36.67^\\circ$ (approximately, as $110^\\circ$ divided by 3 is approximately 36.67^\\circ)\n\nSo, rounding to the nearest whole degree:\n- $AFD ≈ 70^\\circ + 37^\\circ = 107^\\circ$\n\nTherefore, the degree measure of angle $AFD$ is approximately $107^\\circ$.\n\nboxed{107^\\circ}"
