      "In how many ways can $7$ people sit around a round table if no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other? (Seating arrangements which are rotations of each other are treated as the same.)"

      "To solve this problem, we'll use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's start by finding the total number of ways for the 7 people to sit around the table without any restrictions. Since there are 7 seats, there are 7 choices for the first person, then 6 choices for the second, and so on, down to 1 choice for the last person. \n\nTotal ways without restrictions = 7! (7 factorial) = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together. We can treat them as a single unit, so we have 5 \"people\" to arrange: the unit of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, and the other 4 individuals. There are 5! ways to arrange these 5 \"people\" around the table.\n\nHowever, within the unit of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, they can be arranged in 3! ways themselves.\n\nSo, the number of ways with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas together = 5! × 3! = 120 × 6 = 720\n\nNow, we overcounted because we didn't account for the cases where pairs of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together. There are 3 such pairs: Pierre-Rosa, Pierre-Thomas, and Rosa-Thomas. For each pair, we can treat them as a single unit, and the problem becomes arranging 4 units (the pair and the other 3 individuals) around the table, which gives us 4! ways.\n\nSo, the number of ways with pairs together = 3 × 4! = 3 × 24 = 72\n\nNow we apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal ways with restrictions = Total ways without restrictions - Ways with all 3 together + Ways with pairs together\n= 5040 - 720 + 72\n= 4320 + 72\n= 4392\n\nSo, there are 4392 ways for the 7 people to sit around the table with the given restrictions. Putting this in a box:\n\n\\boxed{4392}"
