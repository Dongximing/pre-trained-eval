      "If $2^8=4^x$, what is the value of $x$?"
    ],
    "answer": "4",
    "output": [
      "To solve the equation $2^8 = 4^x$, we can express both sides of the equation using the same base. Since $4$ is equal to $2^2$, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n$$2^8 = (2^2)^x$$\n\nNow, using the property of exponents that states $(a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}$, we can simplify the right side:\n\n$$2^8 = 2^{2 \\cdot x}$$\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\n$$8 = 2x$$\n\nNow, to find $x$, we divide both sides by $2$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{8}{2}$$\n$$x = 4$$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $4$. Placing it in a box:\n\n$$\\boxed{4}$$"
