      "To solve the equation $x = \\sqrt{11-2x} + 4$, we will first isolate the square root term. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant on the right side:\n   $$ x - 4 = \\sqrt{11-2x} $$\n\n2. Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root. This will introduce a potential extraneous solution, so we'll need to check our results at the end:\n   $$ (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x $$\n\n3. Expand the left side:\n   $$ x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x $$\n\n4. Move all terms to one side to set the equation equal to zero:\n   $$ x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 $$\n\n5. Factor the quadratic equation:\n   $$ (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0 $$\n\n6. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n   $$ x - 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 1 = 0 $$\n   $$ x = 5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 1 $$\n\n7. Now we need to check if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation. If $x = 5$:\n   $$ 5 = \\sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4 $$\n   $$ 5 = \\sqrt{11 - 10} + 4 $$\n   $$ 5 = \\sqrt{1} + 4 $$\n   $$ 5 = 1 + 4 $$\n   $$ 5 = 5 $$\n\n   The solution $x = 5$ is valid.\n\n8. If $x = 1$:\n   $$ 1 = \\sqrt{11 - 2(1)} + 4 $$\n   $$ 1 = \\sqrt{11 - 2} + 4 $$\n   $$ 1 = \\sqrt{9} + 4 $$\n   $$ 1 = 3 + 4 $$\n   $$ 1 = 7 $$\n\n   This is not true, so $x = 1$ is an extraneous solution.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is $x = 5$. The final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{x = 5}"
