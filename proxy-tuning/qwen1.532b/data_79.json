      "For what value of $x$ is $2^3\\cdot3^x=72$?"
    ],
    "answer": "2",
    "output": [
      "To solve the equation $2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72$, we can start by simplifying the left side of the equation. Since $2^3$ is equal to $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2$, which is $8$, the equation becomes:\n\n$$8 \\cdot 3^x = 72$$\n\nNow, our goal is to find the value of $x$ that makes this equation true. To do this, we need to isolate $3^x$. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 8, which is $2^3$:\n\n$$\\frac{8 \\cdot 3^x}{8} = \\frac{72}{8}$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$3^x = 9$$\n\nNow, $9$ can be expressed as $3^2$ because $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$. So, we have:\n\n$$3^x = 3^2$$\n\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n\n$$x = 2$$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $2$. We can put this in a box:\n\n$$\\boxed{x = 2}$$"
