      "A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?"
    ],
    "answer": "\\text{east}",
    "output": [
      "To determine the direction the figure skater is facing after spinning 2250 degrees to her right, we can break down the rotation into multiple revolutions around the compass:\n\n1. A full rotation around the compass is 360 degrees. The skater starts facing north.\n2. She completes one full rotation (360 degrees) to the right, which would make her face east.\n3. She completes another full rotation (another 360 degrees), which would make her face south.\n4. Now, she has spun 720 degrees (360 + 360), and she would continue to the next direction, which is west.\n5. She needs to spin an additional 150 degrees (2250 - 2100) to complete the 2250 degrees.\n\nSince she has already gone through the full 360-degree cycle, the additional 150 degrees will be within the west direction. West is 90 degrees counterclockwise from north, so adding 150 degrees more would mean she would be facing 90 + 150 = 240 degrees counterclockwise from north.\n\nHowever, in the context of the compass, 240 degrees is equivalent to 360 - 240 = 120 degrees clockwise from west, which is actually in the direction of south.\n\nSo, when the figure skater finishes her spin, she is facing \\boxed{south}."
