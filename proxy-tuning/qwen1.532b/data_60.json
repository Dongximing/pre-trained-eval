      "To find the ordered triple $(p, q, r)$, we need to use the fact that $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1$ is a factor of $x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r$. This means that if we divide $x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r$ by $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1$, the remainder should be zero. We can use polynomial long division or synthetic division to find the quotient and remainder. Since the degree of the divisor is 3 and the degree of the dividend is 9, the quotient will be a polynomial of degree 6, and the remainder will be a polynomial of degree less than 3 (i.e., a constant or a linear term).\n\nLet's perform polynomial long division:\n\n```\n         x^6 + (3)x^5 + (4)x^4 + (3)x^3 + (4)x^2 + (3)x + (1)\n   ________________________\nx^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 | x^9 + 0x^8 + 0x^7 + px^6 + qx^3 + r\n```\n\nTo find the first term of the quotient, we divide the highest degree term of the dividend by the highest degree term of the divisor:\n\n```\n         x^6\n```\n\nThen we multiply the divisor by this term and subtract it from the dividend:\n\n```\n         x^6\n   ________________________\nx^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 | x^9 + 0x^8 + 0x^7 + px^6 + qx^3 + r\n         - (x^9 - 3x^8 + 4x^7 - x^6)\n   ________________________\n                  3x^8 - 4x^7 + (3)x^6 + qx^3 + r\n```\n\nWe then bring down the next term of the dividend and continue the process:\n\n```\n         x^6 + 3x^5\n   ________________________\nx^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 | x^9 + 0x^8 + 0x^7 + px^6 + qx^3 + r\n         - (x^9 - 3x^8 + 4x^7 - x^6)\n   ________________________\n                  3x^8 - 4x^7 + (3)x^6 + qx^3 + r\n         - (3x^8 - 9x^7 + 12x^6 - 3x^5)\n   ________________________\n                        5x^7 - 8x^6 + (12)x^5 + qx^3 + r\n```\n\nWe continue this until we have no more terms to bring down from the dividend:\n\n```\n         x^6 + 3x^5 + 4x^4 + 3x^3 + 4x^2 + 3x + 1\n   ________________________\nx^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 | x^9 + 0x^8 + 0x^7 + px^6 + qx^3 + r\n         - (x^9 - 3x^8 + 4x^7 - x^6)\n   ________________________\n                  3x^8 - 4x^7 + (3)x^6 + qx^3 + r\n         - (3x^8 - 9x^7 + 12x^6 - 3x^5)\n   ________________________\n                        5x^7 - 8x^6 + (12)x^5 + qx^3 + r\n         - (5x^7 - 15x^6 + 20x^5 - 5x^4)\n   ________________________\n                              -2x^6 + 7x^5 + (20)x^4 + qx^3 + r\n         - (-2x^6 + 6x^5 - 8x^4 + 2x^3)\n   ________________________\n                                      1x^5 + 12x^4 + (18)x^3 + qx^3 + r\n         - (x^5 - 3x^4 + 4x^3 - x^2)\n   ________________________\n                                          4x^4 + 16x^3 + (19)x^2 + qx^3 + r\n         - (4x^4 - 12x^3 + 16x^2 - 4x)\n   ________________________\n                                             4x^3 + 4x^2 + (23)x + r\n         - (4x^3 - 12x^2 + 16x - 4)\n   ________________________\n                                                  16x^2 + (6)x + r\n         - (16x^2 - 48x + 16)\n   ________________________\n                                                      52x - r\n         - (52x - 52)\n   ________________________\n                                                      r\n\n```\n\nSince the remainder is $r$, and the divisor is $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1$, by the remainder theorem, we have:\n\n$r = 52x - r$\n\nThis implies that $2r = 52x$, and thus $r = 26x$. Since $r$ is a constant term, it cannot be a function of $x$, so we must have $r = 0$.\n\nNow, let's look at the coefficients of $x^3$ in the quotient. We have $q + q = 19$, so $q = 9.5$. However, since $q$ should be a constant, we cannot have a fraction here. This means that our initial assumption that $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1$ is a factor of $x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r$ is incorrect. It's possible that there's a typo in the problem or that the given polynomial is not actually divisible by the given factor.\n\nIf we assume that the factor is correct and the problem is stated correctly, we cannot find the values of $p$ and $q$ that would make the remainder zero. Therefore, the answer is that there is no ordered triple $(p, q, r)$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nFinal answer: No such ordered triple exists."
