      "To find the largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $|5x-1|=x+3$, we need to consider two cases because the absolute value function can be positive or negative.\n\nCase 1: $5x - 1 \\geq 0$\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n$$5x - 1 = x + 3$$\nNow, we solve for $x$:\n$$4x = 4$$\n$$x = 1$$\nThis is a valid solution since $5(1) - 1 = 4$, which is greater than or equal to $0$.\n\nCase 2: $5x - 1 < 0$\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n$$-(5x - 1) = x + 3$$\n$$-5x + 1 = x + 3$$\nNow, we solve for $x$:\n$$-6x = 2$$\n$$x = -\\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis is also a valid solution since $5\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - 1 = -\\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{3}{3} = -\\frac{8}{3}$, which is less than $0$.\n\nNow, we compare the two solutions to find the largest value of $x$. Since $1 > -\\frac{1}{3}$, the largest value that satisfies the equation is $x = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{1}$$"
