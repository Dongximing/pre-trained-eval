    "answer": "78",
    "output": [
      "To find the profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of cookies, cupcakes, and brownies, and then subtract the cost of baking the items.\n\n1. **Cookies**: They sell 54 cookies at three for $1. First, we find the price per cookie:\n   $$ \\frac{\\$1}{3 \\text{ cookies}} = \\$0.33 \\text{ per cookie} $$\n\n   Then, we multiply the price per cookie by the total number of cookies sold:\n   $$ \\$0.33 \\times 54 \\text{ cookies} = \\$18.42 $$\n\n2. **Cupcakes**: They sell 20 cupcakes at $2 each:\n   $$ \\$2 \\times 20 \\text{ cupcakes} = \\$40 $$\n\n3. **Brownies**: They sell 35 brownies at $1 each:\n   $$ \\$1 \\times 35 \\text{ brownies} = \\$35 $$\n\n4. **Total Revenue**: Add the revenue from all three:\n   $$ \\$18.42 (\\text{cookies}) + \\$40 (\\text{cupcakes}) + \\$35 (\\text{brownies}) = \\$93.42 $$\n\n5. **Profit**: Subtract the cost of baking from the total revenue:\n   $$ \\$93.42 - \\$15 (\\text{cost}) = \\$78.42 $$\n\nSo, the profit of the math club is $\\boxed{\\$78.42}$."
