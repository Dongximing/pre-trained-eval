    "output": [
      "The volume $V$ of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$V = \\pi r^2 h$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the base, and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.\n\nFrom the diagram, we are given that the radius $r$ is 3 cm (as it's explicitly labeled). We are also given that the volume $V$ is $45\\pi$ cubic cm. We can plug these values into the formula to find the height $h$:\n\n$$45\\pi = \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot h$$\n\nNow we solve for $h$:\n\n$$45 = 9 \\cdot h$$\n\n$$h = \\frac{45}{9}$$\n\n$$h = 5$$\n\nSo the height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.\n\n$$\\boxed{5}$$"
