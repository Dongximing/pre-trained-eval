      "The expression $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 4\\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \\[\n(2\\cdot (3\\cdot 4)) \\cdot (5+1) = 144.\n\\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses)."

      "To determine the number of distinct values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses into the expression $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1$, we need to consider the different ways we can group the multiplication operations using parentheses. Since there are only four factors, there are a limited number of ways to do this.\n\nHere are the possible ways to insert parentheses without rearranging the terms (which would change the meaning of the expression, as multiplication has higher precedence than addition):\n\n1. No parentheses: The expression is evaluated as $2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5)) + 1$ since multiplication is done before addition.\n2. One pair of parentheses: We can group any two factors together. For example, $(2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5) + 1$, $(2 \\cdot 4) \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5) + 1$, or $(2 \\cdot 5) \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4) + 1$.\n3. Two pairs of parentheses: We can group two factors in one pair and the other two in another pair. This gives us $(2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4)) \\cdot (5 + 1)$ and $(2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5)) \\cdot (4 + 1)$.\n4. Three pairs of parentheses: This is not possible since we only have four factors.\n\nSo, there are a total of 1 (no parentheses) + 3 (one pair) + 2 (two pairs) = 6 different ways to insert parentheses that result in distinct values. However, we already know that one of these gives us the value 121 (the original expression without parentheses), and the other two with one pair of parentheses (like the example given) will give us 144 (since the two innermost factors are multiplied first).\n\nWe need to check the two expressions with two pairs of parentheses to see if they give us a new value. Let's do that:\n\n- $(2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4)) \\cdot (5 + 1) = 144$ (as mentioned)\n- $(2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5)) \\cdot (4 + 1) = 2 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 5 = 150$\n\nSo, one of these gives us a new value (150). That means there are two distinct values (121 and 150) that can be obtained by inserting parentheses without rearranging terms.\n\n\\boxed{2}"
