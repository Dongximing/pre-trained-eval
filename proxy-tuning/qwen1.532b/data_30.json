      "To find the product of $6_8$ and $7_8$ in base $8$, we can follow the same process as we would in base $10$ multiplication. Here's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Multiply $6_8$ by $7_8$ as if they were decimal numbers:\n   $$ 6_8 \\times 7_8 = 42_{10} $$\n\n2. Now, we need to convert $42_{10}$ back to base $8$.\n\n3. Start by dividing $42$ by $8$ and writing down the remainder:\n   $$ 42 \\div 8 = 5 \\text{ with a remainder of } 2 $$\n\n4. Write down the remainder as the rightmost digit of the base $8$ result:\n   $$ \\_\\_ \\_\\_ \\_2 $$\n\n5. Now, divide the quotient (5) by $8$ and repeat the process:\n   $$ 5 \\div 8 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 5 $$\n\n6. Write down the new remainder to the left of the previous one:\n   $$ 52 $$\n\nSo, the product $6_8 \\cdot 7_8$ in base $8$ is $52_8$.\n\nboxed{52_8}"
