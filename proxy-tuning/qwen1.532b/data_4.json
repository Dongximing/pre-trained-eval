      "To determine the average speed of each student, we need to find the distance they ran and the time it took them to run that distance, and then divide the distance by the time.\n\n1. Evelyn: The graph does not provide a clear distance for Evelyn, but we can see that she has a time of 4.5 units. Without the distance, we cannot calculate her average speed.\n\n2. Briana: Briana's distance is approximately 2.2 units, and her time is 2.5 units. Her average speed would be \\( \\frac{2.2 \\text{ units}}{2.5 \\text{ units time}} \\).\n\n3. Carla: Carla's distance is approximately 5.2 units, and her time is 4.25 units. Her average speed would be \\( \\frac{5.2 \\text{ units}}{4.25 \\text{ units time}} \\).\n\n4. Debra: Debra's distance is approximately 2.8 units, and her time is 5.6 units. Her average speed would be \\( \\frac{2.8 \\text{ units}}{5.6 \\text{ units time}} \\).\n\n5. Angela: Angela's distance is approximately 1.4 units, and her time is 6.8 units. Her average speed would be \\( \\frac{1.4 \\text{ units}}{6.8 \\text{ units time}} \\).\n\nSince we don't have exact distances for Evelyn and Briana, we can only compare the speeds of Carla, Debra, and Angela. We can calculate their speeds:\n\n- Carla's speed: \\( \\frac{5.2}{4.25} \\approx 1.22 \\text{ units/time} \\)\n- Debra's speed: \\( \\frac{2.8}{5.6} = 0.5 \\text{ units/time} \\)\n- Angela's speed: \\( \\frac{1.4}{6.8} \\approx 0.205 \\text{ units/time} \\)\n\nComparing these, Carla has the greatest average speed, approximately 1.22 units/time.\n\nTherefore, the student with the greatest average speed is \\boxed{Carla}."
