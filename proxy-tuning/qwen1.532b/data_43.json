      "To find the minimum value of the given expression, we'll need to analyze the terms and look for ways to simplify or minimize them. The expression is the sum of three square roots, each containing a quadratic term in x and y. Let's try to simplify each term separately and see if we can find a pattern or a way to optimize them.\n\nFirst term: $\\sqrt{x^2 + 400}$\nThis term is the square root of a perfect square plus 400, which is $(x + 20)^2$. So the first term is just $x + 20$.\n\nSecond term: $\\sqrt{y^2 + 900}$\nThis term is the square root of a perfect square plus 900, which is $(y + 30)^2$. So the second term is just $y + 30$.\n\nThird term: $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100}$\nThis term is more complicated, but we can try completing the square for both x and y. The quadratic part is $x^2 - 80x + y^2 - 100y + 4100$. We can rewrite this as:\n\\[\n(x^2 - 80x + 1600) + (y^2 - 100y + 2500) - 1600 - 2500 + 4100\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2 + 100\n\\]\nTaking the square root, we get:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2} + 10\n\\]\nThis is the distance from the point (x, y) to the point (40, 50) plus 10.\n\nNow, let's look at the overall expression:\n\\[\n(x + 20) + (y + 30) + \\sqrt{(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2} + 10\n\\]\nWe can see that the first two terms are just linear functions of x and y, and the third term is the distance from (x, y) to (40, 50) plus a constant. The minimum value of the distance term will be 0, when (x, y) is at (40, 50). However, since x and y are restricted to the intervals [0, 40] and [0, 50], respectively, the minimum distance will be achieved when (x, y) is at the corner (0, 0).\n\nSo, the minimum value of the expression will be when (x, y) is at (0, 0), and the distance term is 0. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\\[\n(0 + 20) + (0 + 30) + \\sqrt{(0 - 40)^2 + (0 - 50)^2} + 10\n\\]\n\\[\n= 50 + \\sqrt{1600 + 2500} + 10\n\\]\n\\[\n= 50 + \\sqrt{4100} + 10\n\\]\n\\[\n= 60 + \\sqrt{4100}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can approximate the square root of 4100, which is close to 64, so $\\sqrt{4100} \\approx 64$. Therefore, the minimum value is approximately:\n\\[\n60 + 64 = 124\n\\]\n\nSo, the minimum value of the expression within the given intervals is \\boxed{124}."
