      "To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to consider the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the opposite sides are parallel, so the difference in the x-coordinates of any two opposite sides will be the same. Similarly, the difference in the y-coordinates of any two opposite sides will be the same.\n\nLet's call the fourth vertex $(x, y)$. We can start by looking at the difference in x-coordinates between the first two points and the last two points:\n\n1. Difference between (5, 3) and (6, 8): $6 - 5 = 1$\n2. Since the opposite sides are parallel, the difference between (7, 4) and $(x, y)$ should also be 1:\n   $$x - 7 = 1$$\n   $$x = 1 + 7$$\n   $$x = 8$$\n\nNow let's find the difference in y-coordinates between the first two points:\n\n3. Difference between (5, 3) and (6, 8): $8 - 3 = 5$\n\nSince the opposite sides are parallel, the difference between (7, 4) and $(x, y)$ should also be 5, but we already know $x = 8$:\n\n4. $y - 4 = 5$\n5. $y = 5 + 4$\n6. $y = 9$\n\nSo the fourth vertex is $(8, 9)$, and $x + y = 8 + 9 = 17$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x + y$ is $\\boxed{17}$."
