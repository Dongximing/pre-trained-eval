      "A right cylindrical tank with circular bases is being filled with water at a rate of $20\\pi$ cubic meters per hour. As the tank is filled, the water level rises four meters per hour. What is the radius of the tank, in meters? Express your answer in simplest radical form."

      "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is given by:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) is the volume, \\( r \\) is the radius of the circular base, and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder (which is the water level in this case).\n\nWe are given that the volume is increasing at a rate of \\( 20\\pi \\) cubic meters per hour, which we can write as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\\pi \\text{ m}^3/\\text{hr} \\]\n\nWe are also given that the water level (height) is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour, which we can write as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \\text{ m/hr} \\]\n\nSince the volume is increasing at a rate of \\( 20\\pi \\) cubic meters per hour and the height is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour, we can relate these rates using the formula for the volume:\n\n\\[ 20\\pi = \\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( r \\) by dividing both sides by \\( 4\\pi \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{20\\pi}{4\\pi} \\]\n\\[ r^2 = 5 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides to find \\( r \\), we get:\n\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{5} \\]\n\nSo, the radius of the tank is \\( \\sqrt{5} \\) meters. In simplest radical form, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}} \\text{ m}"
