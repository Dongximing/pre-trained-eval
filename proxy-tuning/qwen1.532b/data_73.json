    "output": [
      "To find the value of $9 \\& 2$, we need to substitute $a = 9$ and $b = 2$ into the given operation:\n\n$$a \\& b = \\frac{\\sqrt{a \\cdot b + a}}{\\sqrt{a \\cdot b - b}}$$\n\nLet's plug in $a = 9$ and $b = 2$:\n\n$$9 \\& 2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 2 + 9}}{\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 2 - 2}}$$\n\nNow, we perform the arithmetic inside the square roots:\n\n$$9 \\& 2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{18 + 9}}{\\sqrt{18 - 2}}$$\n$$9 \\& 2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{27}}{\\sqrt{16}}$$\n\nBoth 27 and 16 are perfect squares, so we can simplify the square roots:\n\n$$9 \\& 2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3^3}}{\\sqrt{4^2}}$$\n$$9 \\& 2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\n\nThis is already in simplest radical form, as there are no perfect squares that can be factored out of $\\sqrt{3}$. So the final answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}}$$"
