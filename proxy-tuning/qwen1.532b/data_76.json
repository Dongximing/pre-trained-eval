    "output": [
      "The function $\\log x^2$ is defined for all $x$ except when $x = 0$ because logarithms of zero are undefined. The expression inside the logarithm, $x^2$, is non-negative for all $x$ because squaring a number makes it positive (except for 0, which we've already excluded). \n\nThe logarithm function, $\\log$, can accept any positive real number as its argument. Therefore, the domain of $\\log x^2$ is all $x$ such that $x^2 > 0$, which is true for all $x \\neq 0$.\n\nGiven that the domain is $x < a$ or $x > b$, this implies that $a$ and $b$ are the endpoints of the interval where $x$ is not allowed to be, i.e., $a = 0$ and $b$ is any positive number. Since $x$ can be arbitrarily close to 0 from both sides but not equal to 0, $b$ can be any positive number.\n\nTherefore, $a + b = 0 + b = b$. Since $b$ can be any positive number, the sum $a + b$ is infinite, and we cannot express it as a finite value. However, if we assume that $b$ is approaching a specific finite value, then $a + b$ would approach that value as well (but never actually reach it, because $x$ can be arbitrarily close to 0).\n\nIn the context of a multiple-choice question where you might be expected to enter a numerical answer, you might put:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\infty}$$\n\nThis represents the fact that the sum is unbounded due to the open-ended nature of the domain."
