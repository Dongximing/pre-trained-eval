      "The sum of the first $N$ positive odd numbers can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers with a constant difference between consecutive terms. For odd numbers, the first term ($a_1$) is 1, and the common difference ($d$) is 2, since each odd number is two more than the previous one.\n\nThe sum of the first $N$ odd numbers, $S_N$, can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$S_N = \\frac{N}{2} \\times (2a_1 + (N - 1)d)$$\n\nGiven that $a_1 = 1$ and $d = 2$, we have:\n\n$$S_N = \\frac{N}{2} \\times (2 \\times 1 + (N - 1) \\times 2)$$\n$$S_N = \\frac{N}{2} \\times (2 + 2N - 2)$$\n$$S_N = \\frac{N}{2} \\times 2N$$\n$$S_N = N^2$$\n\nWe are given that $S_N = 121$, so we need to solve for $N$:\n\n$$N^2 = 121$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n$$N = \\sqrt{121}$$\n$$N = 11$$\n\nSo, the value of $N$ is 11.\n\n$$\\boxed{N = 11}$$"
