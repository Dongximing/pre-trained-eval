      "To find the roots of the given cubic equation, we can start by expanding the cubes on both sides. The equation is:\n\n$$(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3$$\n\nLet's expand each cube:\n\n$$(x^3 - 3x^2 \\cdot 3 + 3x \\cdot 9 - 27) + (x^3 - 3x^2 \\cdot 7 + 3x \\cdot 21 - 343) = (8x^3 - 30x^2 + 100x - 1000)$$\n\nSimplifying each term, we get:\n\n$$x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27 + x^3 - 21x^2 + 63x - 343 = 8x^3 - 30x^2 + 100x - 1000$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$2x^3 - 20x^2 + 90x - 370 = 8x^3 - 30x^2 + 100x - 1000$$\n\nNow, move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n$$8x^3 - 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 20x^2 - 100x + 90x + 1000 - 370 = 0$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$6x^3 - 10x^2 - 10x + 630 = 0$$\n\nNow, we have a cubic equation in standard form, $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$, with $a = 6$, $b = -10$, $c = -10$, and $d = 630$. Unfortunately, this cubic does not factor easily, so we cannot find exact roots without using numerical methods or advanced algebraic techniques like Cardano's formula or numerical root-finding algorithms.\n\nHowever, we can try to find integer roots by using the Rational Root Theorem, which states that if a rational root exists, it must divide the constant term $d$. In this case, the possible rational roots are factors of 630: $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm5, \\pm6, \\pm7, \\pm9, \\pm10, \\pm14, \\pm15, \\pm18, \\pm21, \\pm30, \\pm35, \\pm42, \\pm45, \\pm63, \\pm70, \\pm90, \\pm105, \\pm126, \\pm210, \\pm315, \\pm630$.\n\nTrying these values, we find that $x = 5$ is a root because when we substitute $x = 5$ into the equation, the left side becomes $0$:\n\n$$6(5)^3 - 10(5)^2 - 10(5) + 630 = 0$$\n\nNow that we have one root, we can perform polynomial division or synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor. Since the root is $x = 5$, we can write:\n\n$$(x - 5)(6x^2 + bx + c) = 6x^3 - 10x^2 - 10x + 630$$\n\nWe need to find $b$ and $c$ such that:\n\n$$6x^3 - 10x^2 - 10x + 630 = (x - 5)(6x^2 + bx + c)$$\n\nExpanding the right side gives us:\n\n$$6x^3 - 30x^2 + 5bx - 5c = 6x^3 - 10x^2 - 10x + 630$$\n\nMatching coefficients, we get:\n\n$$-30x^2 = -10x^2 \\Rightarrow b = 5$$\n$$-5c = -10x \\Rightarrow c = 2x$$\n\nSince $x = 5$, we have $c = 2(5) = 10$. Thus, the quadratic factor is $6x^2 + 5x + 10$. Now, we can find the remaining roots by solving the quadratic equation:\n\n$$6x^2 + 5x + 10 = 0$$\n\nThis quadratic does not factor easily either, so we'll use the quadratic formula:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nFor our quadratic, $a = 6$, $b = 5$, and $c = 10$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2 - 4(6)(10)}}{2(6)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 240}}{12}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{-215}}{12}$$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots. We can express them in the form $a + bi$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-5 \\pm i\\sqrt{215}}{12}$$\n\nSo, the full set of roots is:\n\n$$x = 5, \\frac{-5 + i\\sqrt{215}}{12}, \\frac{-5 - i\\sqrt{215}}{12}$$\n\nboxed{\\begin{align*}\nx &= 5 \\\\\nx &= \\frac{-5 + i\\sqrt{215}}{12} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{-5 - i\\sqrt{215}}{12}\n\\end{align*}}"
