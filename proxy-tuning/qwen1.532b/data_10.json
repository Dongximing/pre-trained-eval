      "To find the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider two conditions:\n\n1. The number must be a multiple of 30, which means it must be a multiple of both 2 and 5 (since 30 = 2 × 3 × 5).\n2. The number can only consist of the digits 0 and 2.\n\nSince the number must be divisible by 5, it must end in either 0 or 5. However, we can't use the digit 5 since we're limited to 0 and 2. Therefore, the last digit must be 0.\n\nNow, the number must also be divisible by 2, which means it must be even. Since the last digit is 0, this condition is satisfied.\n\nTo make the number as small as possible while still being a multiple of 30, we want to minimize the sum of the digits, as that will minimize the number itself. The smallest sum we can achieve with only 0 and 2 digits is by having the remaining digits as 222...2.\n\nLet's calculate the smallest number:\n\n30 is already a multiple of 2 and 5, and it has a sum of digits (3 + 0) = 3. To make the smallest multiple of 30 with only 0 and 2, we need to add as many 2's as possible without exceeding 30.\n\nWe can add one more 2 to the end (20), which gives us a sum of digits (3 + 2) = 5, which is still a multiple of 5. Now, we have 20 as our number, and it's a multiple of 10 (2 * 5).\n\nTo make it a multiple of 3, we need the sum of the digits to be a multiple of 3. The sum of digits in 20 is 2, which is not a multiple of 3. However, we can add another 2 to the beginning (220), which gives us a sum of digits (2 + 2 + 0) = 4, which is not a multiple of 3 yet.\n\nWe can continue adding 2's to the beginning until we get a sum that's a multiple of 3. The next number would be 2220, with a sum of digits (2 + 2 + 2 + 0) = 6, which is a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is 2220. We can confirm that 2220 is divisible by both 2 (even number) and 3 (sum of digits is 6, which is a multiple of 3), and it's the smallest possible number that meets these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{2220}."
