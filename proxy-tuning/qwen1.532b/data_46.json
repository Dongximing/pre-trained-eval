      "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity, we need to consider the properties of the roots of unity and the given polynomial.\n\nA root of unity is a complex number that satisfies $z^n = 1$ for some positive integer $n$. The $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity are the solutions to the equation $z^n - 1 = 0$. These roots are evenly spaced on the unit circle in the complex plane and can be expressed as $e^{2\\pi ik/n}$, where $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1$.\n\nNow, let's look at the given polynomial $z^4 + z^2 + 1$. This is a quadratic in terms of $z^2$, so let's make a substitution to make it easier to work with:\n\nLet $y = z^2$. Then the equation becomes $y^2 + y + 1 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots using the quadratic formula:\n\n$$y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nFor our equation, $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = 1$. Plugging these into the formula, we get:\n\n$$y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$$\n\nThe roots are $y = \\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $y = \\frac{-1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which are the square roots of the roots of the original equation.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest $n$ such that these roots are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity. Since the roots are complex numbers with a non-zero imaginary part, they cannot be real $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity. However, their squares will be $n^{\\text{th}}$ powers of real roots of unity because squaring will eliminate the imaginary part.\n\nLet's square our roots:\n\n$$y_1^2 = \\left(\\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1 - 2i\\sqrt{3} + 3}{4} = \\frac{4 - 2i\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 1 - \\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n\n$$y_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{-1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1 + 2i\\sqrt{3} + 3}{4} = \\frac{4 + 2i\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 1 + \\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n\nThese are now real numbers, and we can see that they are $4^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity (specifically, $y_1^2 = e^{i\\pi/2}$ and $y_2^2 = e^{-i\\pi/2}$, which are the fourth roots of $1$).\n\nSince $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the square roots of the original roots of $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$, their $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots will be the fourth roots of unity as well. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity is $n = 4$.\n\n\\boxed{n = 4}"
