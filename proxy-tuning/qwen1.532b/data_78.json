      "To find the values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the given equation, we can start by expanding the right side and comparing coefficients. The right side, when expanded, is $(x - a)^2(x - b) = x^3 - (2a + b)x^2 + (a^2 + 2ab)x - a^2b$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 1$ into the equation and equate the coefficients of the powers of $x$:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 + 3x^2 + 1 &= x^3 - (2a + b)x^2 + (a^2 + 2ab)x - a^2b \\\\\n3 &= -2a - b \\\\\n0 &= a^2 + 2ab \\\\\n1 &= -a^2b\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $b = -3 - 2a$. We can substitute this into the second equation to eliminate $b$:\n\n\\[\n0 = a^2 + 2a(-3 - 2a) = a^2 - 6a - 4a^2 = -3a^2 - 6a\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to $3a^2 + 6a = 0$, which further simplifies to $a(3a + 6) = 0$. This gives us two possible values for $a$: $a = 0$ or $a = -2$. Since $a \\neq 0$ according to the problem statement, we discard $a = 0$.\n\nNow, let's find $b$ using $a = -2$:\n\n\\[\nb = -3 - 2(-2) = -3 + 4 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ is \\boxed{(-2, 1)}."
