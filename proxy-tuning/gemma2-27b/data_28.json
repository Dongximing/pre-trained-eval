      "Here's how to find the result step-by-step:\n\n**Understanding Rotations in the Complex Plane**\n\nComplex numbers can be represented as points in the complex plane.  A rotation of a complex number by an angle  θ  around the origin is equivalent to multiplying the complex number by  *cis(θ)*, where *cis(θ) = cos(θ) + i sin(θ)*.\n\n**Applying the Rotation**\n\n1. **Find *cis(90°)***:\n   * cos(90°) = 0\n   * sin(90°) = 1\n   * Therefore, *cis(90°) = 0 + i(1) = i*\n\n2. **Multiply the complex number by *cis(90°)*:**\n   * (7 + 2i) * i = 7i + 2i²\n\n3. **Simplify:**\n   * Remember that i² = -1\n   * 7i + 2i² = 7i - 2 = **-2 + 7i**\n\n\n\n**Answer:** The resulting complex number is  $\\boxed{-2 + 7i}$."
