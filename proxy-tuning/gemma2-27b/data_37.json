      "Here's how to solve this: Kampagne nutriciónLookAndTOBER\n\n **1. Understand Rotational Symmetry**\n\n   A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles.\n\n**2.  Find the Central Angle**\n\n   * A pentagon has 5 equal sides and 5 equal angles.\n   * The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.\n   * Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is 540 / 5 = 108 degrees.\n\n**3. Determine the Minimum Rotation**\n\n   * To coincide with its original position, the pentagon needs to rotate a multiple of 360 degrees.\n   * The smallest multiple of 360 degrees that is also a multiple of 108 degrees is 360 degrees itself.\n\n\n**Answer:**  The minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotatednadequate يتيمه to coincide with its original position is  \\boxed{360}.
