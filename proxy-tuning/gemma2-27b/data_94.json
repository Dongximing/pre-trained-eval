      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand Trisected Angles:**  Since angles BAD and CDA are trisected, each of the smaller angles formed is one-third the measure of the original angle.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:**\n   * Let  'x' represent the measure of each of the smaller angles in angle BAD.\n   * Let 'y' represent the measure of each of the smaller angles in angle CDA.\n\n3. **Write Down Known Angles:**\n   * We knowtwas given that angle BAD = 110° and angle CDA = 100°.\n\n4. **Express Angles in Terms of x and y:**\n   * Angle BAD = 3x = 110°\n   * Angle CDA = 3y = 100°\n\n5. **Solve for x and y:**\n   *  x = 110°/3 \n   *  y = 100°/3\n\n6. **Find Angle AFD:**\n   * Angle AFD is the sum of angles AFE and EFD.\n   * Angle AFE = x = 110°/3\n   * Angle EFD = y = 100°/3\n   * Therefore, angle AFD = (110°/3) + (100°/3) = 210°/3"
