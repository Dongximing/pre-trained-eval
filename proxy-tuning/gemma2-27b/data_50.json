      "You have seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of gold coins. One day, you find a bag of 53 coins. You decide to redistribute the number of coins you have so that all eight bags you hold have the same number of coins. You successfully manage to redistribute all the coins, and you also note that you have more than 200 coins. What is the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins?Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n"

      "Here's how мы can solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the problem:** We need to find the smallest number of coins we had initially so that after adding the 53 coins and distributing them evenly among 8 bags, we have more than 200 coins.\n\n2. **Set up the equation:** Let 'x' be the number of coins in each of the original 7 bags.  \n   * Total coins before finding the extra bag: 7x\n   * Total coins after finding the extra bag: 7x + 53\n   * Coins in each bag after redistribution: (7x + 53) / 8\n\n3. **Use the given information:** We know that after redistribution, each bag has the same number of coins, and this number is greater than 200. So:\n   (7x + 53) / 8 > 200\n\n4. **Solve the inequality:**\n   * Multiply both sides by 8: 7x + 53 > 1600\n   * Subtract 53 from both sides: 7x > 1547\n   * Divide both sides by 7: x > 221\n\n5. **Find the smallest whole number:** Since 'x' represents the number of coins in each bag, it must be a whole number. The smallest whole number"
