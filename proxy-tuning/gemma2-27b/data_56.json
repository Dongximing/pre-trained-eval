Notice that:\n\n*  The odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence (the difference between consecutive terms is constant).\n*  The common difference is 2.\n\n**Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series**\n\nThe sum *S* of the first *N* terms of an arithmetic series is:\n\nS = (N/2) * (first term + last term)\n\n**Applying the Formula**\n\n* **First term:** 1\n* **Last term:**  The *N*th odd number is  2*N - 1 \n* **Sum (S):** 121\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n121 = (N/2) * (1 + 2*N - 1)\n\n**Solving for N**\n\n1. Simplify the equation: 121 = (N/2) * (2*N)\n2. Further simplification: 121 = N²\n3. Take the square root of both sides: N = 11\n\n\n\n \"..\\..\\"
