      "Here's how to find the eighth term of the geometric sequence:\n\n**1. Find the Common Ratio**\n\nA geometric sequence is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value called the common ratio.  To find the common ratio, divide any term by the term before it. \n\nFor example,  \n  *  (25/3) / (125/9) = (25/3) * (9/125) = 3/5\n\nSo, the common ratio is **3/5**.\n\n**2.  Use the Formula**\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:\n\naₙ = a₁ * r^(n-1)\n\nwhere:\n* aₙ is the nth term\n* a₁ is the first term\n* r is the common ratio\n* n is the term number\n\n**3.  Plug in the Values**\n\nWe know:\n* a₁ = 125/9\n* r = 3/5\n* n = 8\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\na₈ = (125/9) * (3/5)^(8-1)\n\n**4. Simplify**\n\na₈ = (125/9) * (3/5)^7\na₈ = (125/9) * (2187/"
