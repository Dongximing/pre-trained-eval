      "Here's how to solve kühl chegadajsonString Infórmanos problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Restriction**\n\nThe function $\\log x^2$ is defined only when its argument, $x^2$, is positive.  This is because the logarithm is only defined for positive numbers.\n\n**2. Analyze  x²**\n\nThe expression $x^2$ is always non-negative (greater than or equal to zero) for all real numbers *x*.  It's equal to zero only when *x* = 0.\n\n**3. Identify the Issue**\n\nSince $x^2$ is always non-negative, the restriction  $x < a$ or $x > b$  must be there to exclude a specific range of *x* values localizaciónipheral himoน يتيمه AssemblyCompany schu betweenstory where the logarithm is undefined.\n\n**4.  Logarithm's Domain**\n\nThe logarithm function is undefined for  $x = 0$.  Therefore, the restriction likely comes from excluding *x* = 0.\n\n**5. Determine a and b**\n\nTo exclude *x* = 0, the domain must be split into two parts:\n\n*  $x < 0$:  This covers all negative values of *x*.\n*  $x > 0$: This covers all positive values of *x*.\n\nSo,  $a = 0$ and $b = 0$.\n\n**"
