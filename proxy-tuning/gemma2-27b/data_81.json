      "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**Let's use variables:**\n\n*  Let 't' represent the weight of one treek.\n*  Let 's' represent the weight of one squig.\n*  Let 'g' represent the weight of one goolee.\n\n**Set up equations based on the given information:**\n\n*  \"Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee\":  10t = 3s + g \n*  \"Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig\": 2t + g = s\n\n**Solve for 't' (the weight of one treek):**\n\n1. **Solve the second equation for 'g':**\n   g = s - 2t\n\n2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into the first equation:**\n   10t = 3s + (s - 2t)\n\n3. **Simplify and solve for 't':**\n   10t = 4s - 2t\n   12t = 4s\n   t = (4s) / 12\n   t = s / 3\n\n**Find the weight of one squig in terms of treeks:**\n\nSince we know t = s/3, we can substitute this back into the equation 2t + g = s"
