      "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Estimate the Square Roots**\n\n*  We know that $2^2 = 4$ and $3^2 = 9$, so $2 < \\sqrt{7} < 3$ and $2 < \\sqrt{5} < 3$.\n\n**2. Find a Lower Bound**\n\n* Since $\\sqrt{7} > 2$ and $\\sqrt{5} > 2$, we have:\n   $(\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{5})^6 > (2 + 2)^6 = 4^6 = 4096$\n\n**3. Find an Upper Bound**\n\n* Since $\\sqrt{7} < 3$ and $\\sqrt{5)<3$, we have:\n   $(\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{5})^6 < (3 + 3)^6 = 6^6 = 46656$\n\n**4. Consider the Range**\n\n* We know that $(\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{5})^6$ is between 4096 and 46656.\n\n**5. Find the Greatest Integer Less Than the Upper Bound**\n\n* The greatest integer less than 46656 is 46655.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer less than $(\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{5})^6"
