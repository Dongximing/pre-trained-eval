This suggests that geometry might be helpful.  \n\n**Key Idea: Triangle Inequality**\n\nThe Triangle Inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the length of the third side.\n\n**Applying the Triangle Inequality**\n\nLet's represent the terms under the square roots as distances:\n\n*  √(x² + 400) represents the distance from the point (x, 0) to the point (0, 20).\n*  √(y² + 900) represents the distance from the point (0, y) to the point (0, 30).\n*  √(x² + y² - 80x - 100y + 4100) represents the distance from the point (x, y) to the point (40, 50).\n\nNow, imagine these three points forming a triangle.  By the Triangle Inequality:\n\n*  √(x² + 400) + √(y² + 900) ≥ √(x² + y² - 80x - 100y + 4100)\n\n**Minimizing the"
