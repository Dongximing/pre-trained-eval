      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Expand the product:**\n\nWhen we multiply out  $(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)$, we get:\n\n $$12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a$$\n\n**2. Combine like terms:**\n\nGroup the terms with the same powers of *t*:\n\n$$12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (5b - 6 + 4a)t^2 + (ab - 10)t - 2a$$\n\n**3. Match coefficients:**\n\nWe know this expanded form is equal to $12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6$.  For the two expressions to be equal, the coefficients of the corresponding terms must be equal. This gives us a system of equations:\n\n*  $3b + 20 = 26$ \n*  $5b - 6 + 4a = -8$\n*  $ab - 10 = -16$\n*  $-2a = 6$\n\n"
