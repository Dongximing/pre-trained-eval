    "output": [
      "Here's how to convert the binary number $10101001110_2$ to base eight (octal):\n\n**1. Group the Binary Digits:**\n\n   Starting from the rightmost digit, group the binary digits into sets of three. If you don't have enough digits to make a complete group of three at the end, add leading zeros:\n\n   ```\n   010 101 001 110 \n   ```\n\n**2. Convert Each Group to Octal:**\n\n   Each group of three binary digits represents a single octal digit.  Here's the conversion:\n\n   *  `010` = 2\n   *  `101` = 5\n   *  `001` = 1\n   *  `110` = 6\n\n**3. Combine the Octal Digits:**\n\n   Combine the octal digits you found:\n\n   2 5 1 6\n\n**Therefore, the binary number $10101001110_2$ is equal to $\\boxed{2516_8}$.**"
