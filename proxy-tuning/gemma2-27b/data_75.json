Find the total possible outcomes.**\n\n*   Each die has 6 sides.\n*   There are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations when rolling two dice.\n\n**2.  Find the outcomes where the product is a multiple of 5.**\n\nA product is a multiple of 5 if at least one of the dice rolls a 5.  Here are the possibilities:\n\n*   Die 1 is 5, Die 2 is any number (6 possibilities)\n*   Die 2 is 5, Die 1 is any number (6 possibilities)\n\nThat's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 outcomes.\n\n**3.  Calculate the probability.**\n\nProbability is calculated as:\n\n (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the probability is 12/36, which simplifies to **1/3**.\n\n\n\n"
