      "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Convert to Base 10**\n\nFirst, we need to convert the base 8 numbers to base 10:\n\n*  $6_8 = 6 \\cdot 8^0 = 6$\n*  $7_8 = 7 \\cdot 8^0 = 7$\n\n**2. Multiply in Base 10**\n\nNow we multiply the base 10 equivalents:\n\n*  $6 \\cdot 7 = 42$\n\n**3. Convert the Product to Base 8**\n\nTo convert 42 to base 8, we find the largest power of 8 that is less than 42, which is $8^1 = 8$. how many times does 8 go into 42? Five times ($5 \\cdot 8 = 40$). This gives us our first digit in base 8.\n\nWe have a remainder of 2 ($42 - 40 = 2$).  Since 2 is less than 8, it becomes our second digit.\n\n**4. Express the Answer**\n\nTherefore, $42$ in base 8 is $52_8$.\n\n\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{52_8}$"
