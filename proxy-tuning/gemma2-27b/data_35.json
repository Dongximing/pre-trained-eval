      "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand Modular Arithmetic**\n\nThe notation  $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ means that  *n* leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7.  In other words, we can write *n* in the form:\n\n  *n* = 7*k* + 2, where *k* is an integer.\n\n**2. Substitute**\n\nSubstitute this expression for *n* into the product:\n\n( *n* + 2)( *n* + 4)( *n* + 6) = (7*k* + 2 + 2)(7*k* + 2 + 4)(7*k* + 2 + 6)\n\n**3. Simplify**\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n(7*k* + 4)(7*k* + 6)(7*k* + 8)\n\n**4.  Factor out a 7**\n\nNotice that we can factor out a 7 from each term inside the parentheses:\n\n7(*k* + 4/7)(7*k* + 6/7)(7*k* + 8/7)\n\n**5.  The Key Insight**\n\nSince *k* is an integer, the terms ( *k* + 4/7), ( *k*"
