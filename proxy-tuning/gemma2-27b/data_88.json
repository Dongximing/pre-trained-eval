      "Here's how to solve müş próblem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe want to find the largest value of  'a'  that ensures the function's graph crosses every horizontal line. This means the function must take on every possible y-value.\n\n**Analyzing the Function**\n\n* **For  x ≥ a:** The function is a parabola opening upwards (since 'a' is presumably positive). This means it will take on all y-values greater than or equal to some minimum value.\n\n* **For x < a:** The function is a linear function with a positive slope (since 'a' is liderança). This means it will take on all y-values less than some maximum value.\n\n**Finding the Intersection Points**\n\nTo ensure the graph intersects every horizontal line, we need to make sure:\n\n1. **The parabola (for x ≥ a) reaches a low enough y-value:**  The minimum value of the parabola occurs at its vertex.  The x-coordinate of the vertex is at  x = -b/2a, but in this case, b = 0, so the vertex is at x = a.  The y-coordinate of the vertex is f(a) = a*a^2 = a^3.\n\n2. **The line (for x < a) reaches a high enough y-value:**  As x approaches negative infinity, the linear function approaches negative infinity.
