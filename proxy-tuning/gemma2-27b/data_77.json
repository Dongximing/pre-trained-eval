    ],
    "answer": "4",
    "output": [
      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Express both sides of the equation with the same base.**  Notice that 4 can be expressed as 2 squared:  \n   *  $2^8 = (2^2)^x$\n\n2. **Simplify using the power of a power rule:** When raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents.\n   * $2^8 = 2^{2x}$\n\n3. **Solve for *x*.** Since the bases are now the same, we can equate the exponents:\n   * $8 = 2x$\n\n4. **Isolate *x*** by dividing both sides by 2:\n   * $x = 4$\n\n\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
