    "output": [
      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify corresponding angles:** Since $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, we know that the angles formed by these parallel lines and the transversal (the line containing $\\overline{AB}$) are corresponding angles.  \n\n2. **Corresponding angles are equal:** Corresponding angles are always equal. Therefore, the angle marked $x^\\circ$ is equal to the angle at $A$ which is $124^\\circ$.\n\n3. **Solution:** So, $x = \\boxed{124}$."
