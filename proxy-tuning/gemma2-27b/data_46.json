      "Here's how to solvežné problem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Roots of Unity:**  The *n*th roots of unity are the complex numbers that, when raised to the power of *n*, equal 1.  They are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\n* **The Equation:** We're given the equation $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$. We want to find the smallest *n*  such that all the solutions (roots) of this equation are *n*th roots of unity.\n\n**Solving the Equation**\n\n1. **Substitution:** Let's make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let  $y = z^2$.  This transforms the equation into:\n\n   $y^2 + y + 1 = 0$\n\n2. **Quadratic Formula:** Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n   $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\n   Where $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = 1$.\n\n   $y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 1}$\n\n   $y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$\n\n   $y = \\frac{-"
