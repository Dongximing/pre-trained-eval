      "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the roots of unity**\n\nSince $z^5 = 1$,  $z$ is a fifth root of unity.  The fifth roots of unity are the complex numbers that, when raised to the power of 5, equal 1.  They are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\n**2.  List the roots of unity**\n\nThe fifth roots of unity are:\n\n* $z = 1$\n* $z = \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi}{5}$\n* $z = \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{4 \\pi}{5}$\n* $z = \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{6 \\pi}{5}$\n* $z = \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{8 \\pi}{5}$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{cis} \\theta = \\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta$.\n\n**3. Apply the given condition**\n\nWe are given that $z \\neq 1$.  So, we can eliminate the first root.\n\n**4. Use the property成MessageOf a reciprocal root**\n\nA key property is that if $z$ is a root of unity, then its reciprocal, $\\frac{1}{z}$, is also a root of unity.  Furthermore, if $z = \\operatorname <<<<<<<<<<<<<< MaduraConver Trost ?”"
