      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Standard Form of a Circle's Equation**\n\nThe standard form of a circle's equation is:\n\n$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$\n\nwhere:\n* $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle\n* $r$ is the radius of the circle\n\n**2. Complete the Square**\n\nTo get our given equation into standard form, we need to complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms:\n\n* **For the x-terms:** Take half of the coefficient of our $x$ term (-10), square it ((-5)² = 25), and add and subtract it inside the equation:\n   \n   $x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 + 6y + c = 25$\n\n* **For the y-terms:** Take half of the coefficient of our $y$ term (6), square it ((3)² = 9), and add and subtract it inside the equation:\n\n   $x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 + 6y + 9 + c = 25 + 9$\n\n**3. Rewrite as Squared Terms**\n\nNow we can rewrite the left side of the equation as squared terms:"
