      "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Find f(-2):**\n\n* Substitute -2 for *x* in the function:\n   *  f(-2) = (3(-2) - 2) / (-2 - 2)\n   *  f(-2) = (-6 - 2) / (-4)\n   *  f(-2) = -8 / -4\n   *  f(-2) = 2\n\n**2. Find f(-1):**\n\n* Substitute -1 for *x* in the function:\n   * f(-1) = (3(-1) - 2) / (-1 - 2)\n   * f(-1) = (-3 - 2) / (-3)\n   * f(-1) = -5 / -3\n   * f(-1) = 5/3\n\n**3. Find f(0):**\n\n* Substitute 0 for *x* in the function:\n   * f(0) = (3(0) - 2) / (0 - 2)\n   * f(0) = -2 / -2\n   * f(0) = 1\n\n**4. Calculate f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0):**\n\n*  2 + 5/3 + 1 = "
