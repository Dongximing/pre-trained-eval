      "Here's how to find the asymptotes and the solution:\n\n**1. Vertical Asymptotes:**\n\n* Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function equals zero, but the numerator does not. \n* Factor the denominator: \n   *  $x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2)$\n* Set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n   * $x - 7 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = 7$\n   * $x + 2 = 0  \\Rightarrow x = -2$\n\n*Neither of these values make the numerator zero, so the vertical asymptotes are at  $x = 7$ and $x = -2$. Therefore, $a = 7$ and $b = -2$.\n\n**2. Horizontal Asymptote:**\n\n* The degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2).  \n* When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is at $y = 0$. comigo\n\n*Therefore, $c = 0$.\n\n**3. Calculate a + b + c:**\n\n* $a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5$\n\n\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{5}$"
