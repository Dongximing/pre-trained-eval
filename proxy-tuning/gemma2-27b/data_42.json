    "output": [
      "Here's how to solve the inequality step-by-step:\n\n**1. Divide all parts of the inequality by 2:**\n\n   Since we're dealing with a compound inequality, we can divide all parts by 2:\n   \n   $$-2 < x - 1 < 4$$\n\n**2. Add 1 to all parts of the inequality:**\n\n   To isolate *x*, add 1 to all parts of the inequality:\n\n   $$-1 < x < 5$$\n\n**3. Identify *a* and *b*:**\n\n   Now the inequality is in the form  $a < x < b$, where:\n\n   *  $a = -1$\n   *  $b = 5$\n\n**4. Calculate *a + b*:**\n\n   Finally, add *a* and *b*:\n\n   $$a + b = -1 + 5 = 4$$\n\n\n\nTherefore, the value of $a + b$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
