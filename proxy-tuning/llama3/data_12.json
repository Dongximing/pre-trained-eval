    "answer": "284",
    "output": [
      "We first find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142, so their sum is $1+2+4+71+142=220$. The proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110, so their sum is $1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110=\\boxed{284}$."
