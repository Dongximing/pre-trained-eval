      "We first find the distance between $z$ and $c$.  This is given by\n\n\\begin{align*}\n|z-c|&=\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2}-2)^2+(-3-3\\sqrt{2}+3)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{2+2\\sqrt{2}+(-3\\sqrt{2})^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{2+2\\sqrt{2}+18}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{20+2\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{align*}Next, we find the angle between the line segment $\\overline{cz}$ and the positive real axis.  This is given by\n\n$$\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-3-3\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\right)=\\tan^{-1}(-\\sqrt{2})=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}.$$Therefore, the angle between the line segment $\\overline{cw}$ and the positive real axis is $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+\\frac{\\pi}{4}=\\pi$.  This means that the line segment $\\overline{cw}$ is in the third quadrant.  Since the distance between $z$ and $c$ is the same as the distance between $w$ and $c$, we have\n\n$$w=c+\\sqrt{20+2\\sqrt{2}}(\\cos\\pi+i"
