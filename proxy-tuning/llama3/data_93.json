    "answer": "33",
    "output": [
      "We complete the squares to get\n\n$$(x-5)^2-25+(y+3)^2-9+c=0,$$or$$(x-5)^2+(y+3)^2+c-34=0.$$This is a circle with center $(5,-3)$ and radius $r$, where\n\n$$r^2=-c+34.$$We want $r=1$, so $-c+34=1$, and $c=\\boxed{33}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{33}. I hope it is correct."
