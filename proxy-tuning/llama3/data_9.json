      "The expression $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 4\\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \\[\n(2\\cdot (3\\cdot 4)) \\cdot (5+1) = 144.\n\\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n"

    "output": [
      "We can start by counting the number of ways to insert parentheses.  There are 4 spaces where we can insert parentheses, and we can either insert a parenthesis or not.  Therefore, there are $2^4=16$ ways to insert parentheses.  However, some of these ways will give the same value.  For example, $(2\\cdot 3)\\cdot 4\\cdot 5+1$ and $2\\cdot (3\\cdot 4)\\cdot 5+1$ both give the same value.  Therefore, we need to count the number of ways to insert parentheses that will give different values.  We can do this by counting the number of ways to group the numbers.  There are 4 numbers, so there are 4 ways to group them.  However, we can group them in the same way in 2 different ways, so there are actually 2 ways to group them.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ ways to insert parentheses that will give different values.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct."
