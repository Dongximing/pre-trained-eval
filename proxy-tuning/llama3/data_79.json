    "answer": "2",
    "output": [
      "We can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as $2^3\\cdot3^x=8\\cdot3^x$.  Since $72=8\\cdot9=2^3\\cdot3^2$, we have\n\n$$2^3\\cdot3^x=72\\Rightarrow8\\cdot3^x=72.$$Dividing both sides by 8, we get\n\n$$3^x=9=3^2.$$Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal, so $x=\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct."
