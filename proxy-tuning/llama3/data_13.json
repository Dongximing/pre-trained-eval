    "answer": "5",
    "output": [
      "The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula\n\n$$V=\\pi r^2h,$$where $r$ is the radius of the cylinder and $h$ is its height.  Since the volume is given as $45\\pi$, we have\n\n$$45\\pi=\\pi r^2h.$$Dividing both sides by $\\pi$, we obtain\n\n$$45=r^2h.$$Substituting $r=3$, we have\n\n$$45=3^2h\\Rightarrow\\boxed{h=5}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5. I hope it is correct."
