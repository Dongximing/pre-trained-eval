    "answer": "0",
    "output": [
      "The domain of the function $\\log x^2$ is the set of all real numbers $x$ for which $x^2>0$. This is because the logarithm function is only defined for positive real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the domain of the function $\\log x^2$ is the set of all real numbers $x$ except for $x=0$. This can be written as $x<0$ or $x>0$.\n\nSince the problem states that the domain is $x<a$ or $x>b$, we can conclude that $a=0$ and $b=0$. Therefore, $a+b=\\boxed{0}$."
