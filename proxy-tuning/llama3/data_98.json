    "output": [
      "I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo simplify the expression $(-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k)$, we can start by combining like terms.\n\nFirst, let's combine the constant terms:\n\n4 + (-2) = 2\n\nNext, let's combine the terms with the variable k:\n\n(-k) + 3k = 2k\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\boxed{2 + 2k}\n\nTherefore, the final answer is boxed as 2 + 2k."
