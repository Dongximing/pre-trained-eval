      "The function $f$ satisfies the functional equation\n\\[f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1\\]for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$  If $f(1) = 1,$ then find all integers $n$ such that $f(n) = n.$  Enter all such integers, separated by commas.Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n"

    "answer": "1,-2",
    "output": [
      "We can plug in $x=y=1$ to get\n\n$$2f(1)=f(2)-1-1\\Rightarrow f(2)=4.$$Next, we can plug in $x=1$ and $y=2$ to get\n\n$$f(1)+f(2)=f(3)-2-1\\Rightarrow f(3)=6.$$We can plug in $x=1$ and $y=3$ to get\n\n$$f(1)+f(3)=f(4)-3-1\\Rightarrow f(4)=8.$$We can plug in $x=2$ and $y=2$ to get\n\n$$2f(2)=f(4)-4-1\\Rightarrow f(4)=9,$$which is a contradiction.  Therefore, the functional equation is invalid, so there are $\\boxed{\\text{no}}$ integers $n$ such that $f(n)=n.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\text{no}. I hope it is correct."
