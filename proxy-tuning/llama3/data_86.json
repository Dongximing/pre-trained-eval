    "output": [
      "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have 5 shirts, so we can choose one shirt in 5 ways.\n2. For each of the 5 shirts, we have 6 pairs of pants to choose from, so we can choose a pair of pants in 6 ways for each shirt.\n3. For each combination of shirt and pants, we have 8 hats to choose from, so we can choose a hat in 8 ways for each combination of shirt and pants.\n\nTo find the total number of outfits, we multiply the number of ways we can choose each item:\n\n5 (shirts) × 6 (pants) × 8 (hats) = 240\n\nSo, we can make a total of \\boxed{240} outfits consisting of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat."
