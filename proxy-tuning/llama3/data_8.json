      "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\nWe are given two points, $(2, -6)$ and $(-4, 3)$. We need to find the distance between these two points.\n\nThe distance formula is:\n\nDistance = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nWhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\nIn this case, (x1, y1) = (2, -6) and (x2, y2) = (-4, 3). So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nDistance = √((-4 - 2)^2 + (3 - (-6))^2)\n= √((-6)^2 + 9^2)\n= √(36 + 81)\n= √117\n\nNow, we simplify the radical:\n\n√117 = √(9 × 13)\n= 3√13\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{3√13}"
