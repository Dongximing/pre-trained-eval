    "answer": "52_8",
    "output": [
      "We have\n\n$$6_8 \\cdot 7_8 = 6 \\cdot 7 = 42_{10}.$$To convert $42_{10}$ to base $8$, we repeatedly divide by $8$ and keep track of the remainders:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n42 \\div 8 &= 5\\;\\text{R }2\\\\\n5 \\div 8 &= 0\\;\\text{R }5\n\\end{align*}Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we have $\\boxed{52_8}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 52_8. I hope it is correct."
