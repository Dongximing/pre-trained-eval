    "answer": "28",
    "output": [
      "Since $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, we know that $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle BAC$ are alternate interior angles, so they are equal.  Since $\\angle ABC$ is $124^{\\circ}$, we know that $\\angle BAC$ is also $124^{\\circ}$.  Since $\\angle BAC$ and $\\angle BCA$ are base angles of isosceles triangle $ABC$, they are equal, so $\\angle BCA$ is also $124^{\\circ}$.  Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$, we have\n\n$$124^{\\circ}+124^{\\circ}+x^{\\circ}=180^{\\circ}\\Rightarrow\\boxed{x^{\\circ}=32^{\\circ}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 32^{\\circ}. I hope it is correct."
