      "Let's expand the expression using the binomial theorem:\n\n$$\\left(10x^3-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^5 = \\sum_{k=0}^5 \\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^k \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^{5-k}$$\n\nWe want to find the constant term, which means we need to find the term that doesn't have any x's. This will happen when the powers of x in the two terms cancel out. Let's look at the powers of x in each term:\n\n* In the first term, $(10x^3)^k$, the power of x is $3k$.\n* In the second term, $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^{5-k}$, the power of x is $2(5-k)$.\n\nFor the powers of x to cancel out, we need $3k = 2(5-k)$, which simplifies to $k = 3$. This means that the constant term will come from the $k=3$ term in the sum.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the $k=3$ term:\n\n$$\\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^3 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{5!}{3!2!}"
