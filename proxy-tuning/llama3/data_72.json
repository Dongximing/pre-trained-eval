    "answer": "3",
    "output": [
      "Let the radius of the sphere be $r$. Then, the volume of the sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, and the surface area is $4\\pi r^2$. \n\nWe are given that the volume and surface area are numerically equal, so we can set them equal to each other and solve for $r$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3&=4\\pi r^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad\\frac{4}{3}r^3&=4r^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r^3&=3r^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r^2&=3r\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r&=3.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the length of the radius of the sphere is $\\boxed{3}$ units.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct."
