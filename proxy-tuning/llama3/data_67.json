      "The lengths of two opposite sides of a square are decreased by $40\\%$ while the lengths of the other two sides are increased by $50\\%$ to form a rectangle. By what percent does the square's area decrease?Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n"
    ],
    "answer": "10",
    "output": [
      "Let $s$ be the original side length of the square. The area of the original square is $s^2.$\n\nThe new rectangle has two sides of length $0.6s$ and two sides of length $1.5s$. The area of the new rectangle is $(0.6s)(1.5s)=0.9s^2.$\n\nThe percent decrease in area is\n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{s^2-0.9s^2}{s^2}=\\frac{0.1s^2}{s^2}=0.1=10\\%.}$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{10\\%}. I hope it is correct."
