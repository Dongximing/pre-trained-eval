      "Let's break this down step by step!\n\nWe know that:\n\n* 10 treeks weigh as much as 3 squigs and 1 goolee\n* 2 treeks and 1 goolee are equal in weight to 1 squig\n\nWe can start by using the second statement to find the weight of 1 goolee in terms of treeks. Since 2 treeks and 1 goolee are equal in weight to 1 squig, we can set up an equation:\n\n2 treeks + 1 goolee = 1 squig\n\nWe can simplify this equation by subtracting 1 goolee from both sides:\n\n2 treeks = 1 squig - 1 goolee\n\nNow, we can use the first statement to find the weight of 3 squigs and 1 goolee in terms of treeks:\n\n10 treeks = 3 squigs + 1 goolee\n\nWe can substitute the expression for 1 goolee (from the previous step) into this equation:\n\n10 treeks = 3 squigs + (1 squig - 2 treeks)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n12 treeks = 4 squigs\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 4 to find the weight of 1 squig in terms of treeks:\n\n3 treeks = 1 squig\n\nSo, the combined weight of **\\boxed{3"
