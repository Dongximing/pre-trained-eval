      "Let the roots of the polynomial be $r_1, r_2,$ and $r_3.$  Then we know that\n\n$$\nr_1+r_2+r_3=-\\frac{4a}{8}=-\\frac{a}{2}.\n$$\n\nAlso, we know that\n\n$$\nr_1r_2+r_1r_3+r_2r_3=\\frac{2b}{8}=\\frac{b}{4}.\n$$\n\nFinally, we know that\n\n$$\nr_1r_2r_3=-\\frac{a}{8}.\n$$\n\nThe sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5, so we have\n\n$$\n\\log_2 r_1 + \\log_2 r_2 + \\log_2 r_3 = 5.\n$$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as\n\n$$\n\\log_2 (r_1r_2r_3)=5.\n$$\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides, we have\n\n$$\nr_1r_2r_3=2^5=32.\n$$\n\nWe know that $r_1r_2r_3=-\\frac{a}{8},$ so we have\n\n$$\n-\\frac{a}{8}=32.\n$$\n\nSolving for $a$, we have\n\n$$\n\\boxed{a=-256}.\n"
