      "A nice simple algebra question!\n\nLet's start by rewriting the equation:\n\n$2^8 = 4^x$\n\nWe can rewrite $4$ as $2^2$, since $4 = 2 \\times 2$. So, the equation becomes:\n\n$2^8 = (2^2)^x$\n\nNow, we can use the rule of exponents that states $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, where $a$ is a base and $m$ and $n$ are exponents. In this case, $a = 2$, $m = 2$, and $n = x$. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$2^8 = 2^{2x}$\n\nNow, we can equate the exponents on both sides of the equation, since the bases are the same (both are $2$). This gives us:\n\n$8 = 2x$\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $2$:\n\n$x = 8/2$\n\n$x = 4$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
