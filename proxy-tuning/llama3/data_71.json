    "answer": "2516_8",
    "output": [
      "We can convert the binary number $10101001110_2$ to base ten as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n10101001110_2&=1\\cdot2^9+0\\cdot2^8+1\\cdot2^7+0\\cdot2^6+1\\cdot2^5+0\\cdot2^4+0\\cdot2^3+1\\cdot2^2+1\\cdot2^1+0\\cdot2^0\\\\\n&=512+0+128+0+32+0+0+4+2+0\\\\\n&=\\boxed{678}.\n\\end{align*}To convert this to base eight, we repeatedly divide by 8 and keep track of the remainders.  We have \\begin{align*}\n678&=84\\cdot8+6,\\\\\n84&=10\\cdot8+4,\\\\\n10&=1\\cdot8+2,\\\\\n1&=0\\cdot8+1.\n\\end{align*}Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we find that $678_{10}=1246_8$, so our final answer is $\\boxed{1246_8}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{1246_8}. I hope it is correct."
