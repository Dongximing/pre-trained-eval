      "Bill walks $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile south, then $\\frac{3}{4}$ mile east, and finally $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile south. How many miles is he, in a direct line, from his starting point?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n"
    ],
    "answer": "1.25",
    "output": [
      "Let $x$ be the distance from Bill's starting point to his ending point.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\nx^2&=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{25}{16}\\\\\n&=\\frac{29}{16}.\n\\end{align*}Taking the square root of both sides, we get\n\n$$x=\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{29}{16}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{4}\\approx1.¾}.$$So, Bill is approximately $1.75$ miles from his starting point.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{1.75}. I hope it is correct."
