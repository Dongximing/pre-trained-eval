      "Point $A$ lies somewhere within or on the square which has opposite corners at $(0,0)$ and $(2,2)$. Point $B$ lies somewhere within or on the square which has opposite corners at points $(4,2)$ and $(5,3)$. What is the greatest possible value of the slope of the line containing points $A$ and $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n"
