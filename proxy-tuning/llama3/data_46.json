    "answer": "6",
    "output": [
      "Let $r$ be a root of the equation $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$.  Then\n\n$$r^4 + r^2 + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow r^4 + r^2 = -1.$$Multiplying both sides by $r^2$, we have\n\n$$r^6 + r^4 = -r^2.$$Adding $1$ to both sides, we have\n\n$$r^6 + r^4 + 1 = 1 - r^2.$$Factoring the left-hand side, we have\n\n$$(r^2 + 1)(r^4 - r^2 + 1) = 1 - r^2.$$Since $r^4 + r^2 + 1 = 0$, we have $r^2 + 1 = -r^4$, so\n\n$$(-r^4)(r^4 - r^2 + 1) = 1 - r^2 \\Rightarrow r^8 - r^6 + r^4 = 1 - r^2.$$Adding $r^6$ to both sides, we have\n\n$$r^8 + r^4 = 1 + r^6 - r^2.$$Factoring the left-hand side, we have\n\n$$r^4(r^4 + 1) = 1 + r^6 - r^2.$$Since $r^4 +"
