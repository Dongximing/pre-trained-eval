      "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 196:**\n   - 196 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n   \\[\n   196 \\div 2 = 98\n   \\]\n   - 98 is also even, so it is divisible by 2.\n   \\[\n   98 \\div 2 = 49\n   \\]\n   - 49 is not divisible by 2, but it is \\(7 \\times 7\\).\n   \\[\n   49 = 7 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Using the Prime Factorization to Find the Number of Divisors:**\n   - If a number \\( n \\) has a prime factorization of the form \\( p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\cdots \\times p_k^{e_k} \\), the number of positive divisors of \\( n \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n   \\]\n   - For \\( 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\):\n     - The exponent of 2 is 2.\n     - The exponent of 7 is 2.\n   - Applying the formula:\n   \\[\n   (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).<|eot_id|>"
