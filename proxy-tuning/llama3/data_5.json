    "answer": "42",
    "output": [
      "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\n1. Since the perimeter of one of the triangles is 21 inches, we can find the length of each side of the triangle by dividing the perimeter by 3 (since there are 3 sides in a triangle):\n\n21 ÷ 3 = 7 inches\n\nSo, each side of the triangle is 7 inches long.\n\n2. Since the hexagon is made up of 6 equilateral triangles, we can multiply the length of one side of the triangle by 6 to find the perimeter of the hexagon:\n\n7 inches/side × 6 sides = 42 inches\n\nSo, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 42 inches.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n\\boxed{42}"
