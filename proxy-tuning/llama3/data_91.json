    ],
    "answer": "1",
    "output": [
      "We know that the expression under the square root must be non-negative, so $x-1 \\ge 0$, which implies $x \\ge 1$. \n\nAlso, the denominator cannot be zero, so $x-2 \\neq 0$, which implies $x \\neq 2$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value is $\\boxed{3}$."
