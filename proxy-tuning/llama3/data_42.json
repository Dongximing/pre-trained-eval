      "The solution to $-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8$ is expressed in the form $a < x < b$. Find the value of $a + b$.Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n"

    "answer": "4",
    "output": [
      "We can start by distributing the 2 to the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n$$-4 < 2x - 2 < 8$$\n\nNext, we can add 2 to all three parts of the inequality to get:\n\n$$-2 < 2x < 10$$\n\nFinally, we can divide all three parts of the inequality by 2 to get:\n\n$$-1 < x < 5$$\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is $-1 < x < 5$, and the value of $a + b$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
