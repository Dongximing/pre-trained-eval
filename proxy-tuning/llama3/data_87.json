    "answer": "1",
    "output": [
      "We can rewrite the equation as $5x-1=\\pm(x+3)$.  We can split this into two cases: $5x-1=x+3$ and $5x-1=-(x+3)$.\n\nCase 1: $5x-1=x+3$\n\nSubtracting $x$ from both sides, we get $4x-1=3$, so $4x=4$, so $x=\\boxed{1}$.\n\nCase 2: $5x-1=-(x+3)$\n\nAdding $x+3$ to both sides, we get $5x+x=1+3$, so $6x=4$, so $x=\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nComparing the two solutions, we see that the largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct."
