    "answer": "16",
    "output": [
      "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the expression |(1-i)^8|.\n2. To evaluate this expression, we can start by simplifying the exponentiation:\n(1-i)^8 = ((1-i)^2)^4\n= (1^2 - 2i + i^2)^4\n= (-1)^4\n= 1\n3. Now we need to find the absolute value of 1, which is simply 1.\n4. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{|(1-i)^8| = 1}"
