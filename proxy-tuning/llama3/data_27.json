    "output": [
      "Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. The math club sells 54 cookies at 3 for $\\$1$, so they sell 18 sets of 3 cookies. Each set costs$\\$1$, so they make $18 \\times \\$1 = \\$18$from the cookies.\n\n2. They sell 20 cupcakes at $\\$2$each, so they make$20 \\times \\$2 = \\$40$from the cupcakes.\n\n3. They sell 35 brownies at $\\$1$each, so they make$35 \\times \\$1 = \\$35$from the brownies.\n\n4. The total amount of money they make is the sum of the money they make from the cookies, cupcakes, and brownies: $\\$18 + \\$40 + \\$35 = \\$93$.\n\n5. It cost the math club $\\$15$to bake these items, so their profit is the total amount of money they make minus the cost: $\\$93 - \\$15 = \\boxed{\\$78}$."
