    "output": [
      "We know that the graph of $y=a\\sin(bx+c)+d$ has a maximum value of $a+d$ and a minimum value of $-a+d$.  From the graph, we can see that the maximum value is 3 and the minimum value is -1.  Therefore, we have $a+d=3$ and $-a+d=-1$.  Solving this system of equations, we get $a=2$ and $d=1$.  Since $c$ is in radians, we know that $c$ must be in the interval $[0,2\\pi)$.  From the graph, we can see that the graph has a maximum value at $x=-\\frac{\\pi}{3}$.  Therefore, we have $-\\frac{\\pi}{3}=-\\frac{c}{b}+\\frac{\\pi}{2b}$.  Solving for $c$, we get $c=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}$.  However, this is not in the interval $[0,2\\pi)$.  Therefore, we must subtract $2\\pi$ from $c$ to get $c=\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{\\pi}{3}. I hope it is correct."
