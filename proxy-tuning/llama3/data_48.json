      "I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo find the power of 4 that is equal to 8, we can start by writing 8 as a power of 2:\n\n8 = 2^3\n\nNow, we can rewrite 2^3 as a power of 4 by using the fact that 4 = 2^2:\n\n2^3 = (2^2)^1.5\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n2^3 = 4^1.5\n\nSo, the power of 4 that is equal to 8 is \\boxed{4^{3/2}}."
