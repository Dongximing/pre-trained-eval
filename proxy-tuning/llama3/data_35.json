      "If $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, then find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n"

    "answer": "3",
    "output": [
      "Since $n\\equiv2\\pmod7$, we know that $n=7k+2$ for some integer $k$.  Then\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(n+2)(n+4)(n+6)&=(7k+2+2)(7k+2+4)(7k+2+6)\\\\\n&=(7k+4)(7k+6)(7k+8)\\\\\n&=(7k+4)(7k+6)(7k+7+1)\\\\\n&=(7k+4)(7k+6)(7k+7)+1\\\\\n&=(7k+4)(7k+6)(7k+7)+1\\\\\n&\\equiv(0)(0)(0)+1\\pmod7\\\\\n&\\equiv\\boxed{1}\\pmod7.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct."
