I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the sum of all numbers in a 9x9 multiplication table except for a given X. Hmm. So the multiplication table is where each cell (i,j) contains i multiplied by j. Right. And there are 81 numbers in total. The task is to sum all of them except the ones that are equal to X. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to generate all the numbers in the table. Then, sum them up, subtract the count of X multiplied by X's value. Wait, no. Wait, because if there are multiple instances of X, each occurrence should be subtracted once. So the approach would be: calculate the total sum of all elements in the table, then subtract X multiplied by the number of times X appears in the table. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n1. Compute the total sum of all elements in the 9x9 multiplication table.\n2. Find how many times X appears in the table.\n3. Subtract (X * count) from the total sum to get the answer.\n\nBut how to compute the total sum? Well, the multiplication table is i * j for i from 1 to 9 and j from 1 to 9. So the total sum is the sum of i*j for all i and j. \n\nAlternatively, since the sum of i*j over i and j is equal to (sum of i from 1 to 9) multiplied by (sum of j from 1 to 9). Because sum_{i=1}^9 sum_{j=1}^9 i*j = (sum i) * (sum j). Since sum i is same as sum j here. So sum i from 1 to 9 is (9*10)/2 = 45. So total sum is 45 * 45 = 2025. Oh right! So the total sum is 2025. \n\nWait, that's a big insight. So the total sum is 45*45 = 2025. So for example, sample input 1 is X=1. The output is 2024. Which is 2025 - 1. So that makes sense. Because the sum of all numbers is 2025, and if X is 1, then subtract 1 once. So how many times does X appear in the table?\n\nSo the problem reduces to: compute the total sum (which is 2025) minus X multiplied by the number of times X appears in the table. \n\nSo the key is to find the count of X in the multiplication table. \n\nSo how to find the count of X in the table? For each i and j, i*j = X. So the number of pairs (i,j) where i and j are between 1 and 9, inclusive, and i*j = X. \n\nSo for example, if X is 1, then only (1,1) gives 1. So count is 1. So the answer is 2025 - 1*1 = 2024, which matches sample 1. \n\nSample 2: X is 11. Let's see. How many pairs (i,j) where i*j=11. Since 11 is a prime number. So possible pairs are (1,11) but j can't be 11 since the table is 9x9. So j can be up to 9. So there are no such pairs. So count is zero. So the answer is 2025 - 0 = 2025. Which matches sample 2. \n\nSample 3: X is 24. Let's find how many times 24 appears. Let's think. \n\nFind all pairs (i,j) where i*j=24, with 1<=i,j<=9. \n\nPossible factors:\n\ni can be from 1 to 9. For each i, check if 24 is divisible by i, and j=24/i is between 1 and 9. \n\nLet me list all possible i:\n\ni=1 → j=24 → no (since j=24>9)\ni=2 → j=12 → no\ni=3 → j=8 → yes. So (3,8)\ni=4 → j=6 → yes. (4,6)\ni=6 → j=4 → yes. (6,4)\ni=8 → j=3 → yes. (8,3)\ni=12 → no. So for i up to 9. \n\nWait, also check i=24? No, since i can't be more than 9. \n\nSo for i in 1-9, check if 24 is divisible by i, and j=24/i is between 1-9. \n\nSo for i=3, j=8. i=4, j=6. i=6, j=4. i=8, j=3. Also, i=24/ j. Wait, what about i=2? j=12, which is invalid. i=1? j=24 invalid. i= 24/ j. \n\nSo the valid pairs are (3,8), (4,6), (6,4), (8,3). So that's 4 occurrences. So the count is 4. So the answer is 2025 - 24 *4 = 2025 - 96 = 1929. Which matches sample 3. \n\nSo the problem now is to compute the count of X in the multiplication table. \n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n- Read X.\n\n- Compute the total sum as 2025.\n\n- Compute the count of X in the table.\n\n- The answer is total_sum - X * count.\n\nSo how to compute the count?\n\nWe can loop through all possible i and j (from 1 to 9) and check if i*j == X. Count the number of such occurrences.\n\nBut since X can be up to 81, which is 9*9. So for each X, the maximum possible count is 9 (for example, X=1, but that's only 1 occurrence. Or X=9, which can be (1,9), (3,3), (9,1) → 3 occurrences.)\n\nSo the code can be:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, 10):\n\n    for j in range(1, 10):\n\n        if i * j == X:\n\n            count +=1\n\nSo that's straightforward. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead X. \n\ntotal = 2025\n\ncount = number of (i,j) pairs where i*j = X.\n\nans = total - X * count\n\nprint(ans)\n\nSo that's the plan. \n\nNow, let's test this with sample input 1:\n\nSample 1: X=1. count is 1. So 2025 - 1*1 = 2024. Correct.\n\nSample 2: X=11. count is 0. 2025 - 0 = 2025. Correct.\n\nSample 3: X=24. count is 4. 2025 - 24*4 = 2025 - 96 = 1929. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code steps:\n\nRead X from input. Then compute count as above.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead X as integer.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in 1..9:\n\n    for j in 1..9:\n\n        if i*j == X:\n\n            count +=1\n\nans = 2025 - X * count\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes. So the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead X from stdin. So:\n\nX = int(input())\n\nThen compute count.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, 10):\n\n    for j in range(1, 10):\n\n        if i * j == X:\n\n            count +=1\n\nans = 2025 - X * count\n\nprint(ans)\n\nThat's the code. \n\nLet me test for X=1. \n\nYes. \n\nWhat about X=9?\n\nLet's see. How many times does 9 appear?\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(1,9), (3,3), (9,1). Also (9,1) is valid. So count is 3. So ans is 2025 - 9*3 = 2025 -27 = 1998. \n\nAnother example. Let's say X= 81. Which is 9*9. So count is 1. So ans is 2025 - 81*1 = 2025 -81 = 1944.\n\nYes. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nSo the code is as written.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of all integers in a 9x9 multiplication table, excluding a given integer X. The multiplication table contains integers where each cell at the i-th row and j-th column contains the product of i and j. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Multiplication Table**: The 9x9 multiplication table consists of integers from 1 to 9 multiplied by each other. Each cell (i, j) contains the value i * j.\n2. **Total Sum Calculation**: The sum of all elements in the multiplication table can be derived using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. The sum of the first 9 natural numbers is 45. Therefore, the total sum of all elements in the table is $45 \\times 45 = 2025$.\n3. **Counting Occurrences of X**: We need to count how many times the given integer X appears in the multiplication table. This is done by iterating through all possible pairs (i, j) where both i and j range from 1 to 9 and checking if their product equals X.\n4. **Adjusting the Total Sum**: Subtract the sum of all occurrences of X from the total sum of the table. This is done by subtracting $X \\times \\text{count}$ from the total sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nX = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(1, 10):\n    for j in range(1, 10):\n        if i * j == X:\n            count += 1\ntotal = 2025\nresult = total - X * count\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input integer X is read from standard input.\n2. **Counting Occurrences**: We use nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs (i, j) in the range 1 to 9. For each pair, we check if their product equals X and count the occurrences.\n3. **Total Sum Calculation**: The total sum of the multiplication table is precomputed as 2025.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is obtained by subtracting the sum of all occurrences of X (calculated as $X \\times \\text{count}$) from the total sum of the table. This gives the sum of all integers in the table that are not equal to X.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging mathematical insights and straightforward iteration, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
