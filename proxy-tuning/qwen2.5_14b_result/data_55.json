      "To determine the degree of the polynomial \\( f(x) \\), we start with the given equation:\n\n\\[\n(x-1) \\cdot f(x) = 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's denote the polynomial on the right-hand side as \\( P(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(x) = 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the degree of \\( f(x) \\). Let's denote the degree of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( \\deg(f) \\).\n\nThe degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\deg((x-1) \\cdot f(x)) = \\deg(x-1) + \\deg(f(x))\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\deg(x-1) = 1 \\), we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\deg((x-1) \\cdot f(x)) = 1 + \\deg(f(x))\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, the degree of \\( P(x) \\) is the highest power of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\). From the given polynomial \\( P(x) = 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17 \\), we see that the highest power of \\( x \\) is 4. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\deg(P(x)) = 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( (x-1) \\cdot f(x) = P(x) \\), we equate the degrees:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\deg(f(x)) = 4\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\deg(f(x)) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\deg(f(x)) = 4 - 1 = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the degree of \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"
