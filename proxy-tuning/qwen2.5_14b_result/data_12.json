      "To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the proper divisors of 284.\n2. Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.\n3. Identify the proper divisors of the sum obtained in step 2.\n4. Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the proper divisors of 284.**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of 284:\n\\[ 284 = 2^2 \\times 71 \\]\n\nThe divisors of 284 are: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, 284. The proper divisors are all the divisors except 284 itself:\n\\[ 1, 2, 4, 71, 142 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.**\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Identify the proper divisors of 220.**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of 220:\n\\[ 220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11 \\]\n\nThe divisors of 220 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, 220. The proper divisors are all the divisors except 220 itself:\n\\[ 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.**\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284 \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is:\n\\[ \\boxed{284} \\]"
