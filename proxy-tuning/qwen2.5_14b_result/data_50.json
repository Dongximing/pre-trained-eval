      "You have seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of gold coins. One day, you find a bag of 53 coins. You decide to redistribute the number of coins you have so that all eight bags you hold have the same number of coins. You successfully manage to redistribute all the coins, and you also note that you have more than 200 coins. What is the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins?"

      "To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins, given that after redistributing all the coins, each of the eight bags has the same number of coins and the total number of coins is more than 200.\n\nLet's denote the number of coins in each of the original seven bags as \\( x \\). Therefore, the total number of coins before finding the bag of 53 coins is \\( 7x \\). After finding the bag of 53 coins, the total number of coins becomes \\( 7x + 53 \\).\n\nSince the coins are redistributed such that each of the eight bags has the same number of coins, the total number of coins must be divisible by 8. Therefore, \\( 7x + 53 \\) must be divisible by 8. We can express this condition as:\n\\[ 7x + 53 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8} \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 7x \\equiv -53 \\pmod{8} \\]\nSince \\(-53 \\equiv -53 + 64 = 11 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}\\), we have:\n\\[ 7x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8} \\]\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we need the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 8. The inverse of 7 modulo 8 is a number \\( y \\) such that:\n\\[ 7y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\]\nBy testing values, we find that \\( y = 7 \\) because:\n\\[ 7 \\cdot 7 = 49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\]\nThus, we multiply both sides of the congruence \\( 7x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8} \\) by 7:\n\\[ x \\equiv 3 \\cdot 7 \\pmod{8} \\]\n\\[ x \\equiv 21 \\pmod{8} \\]\n\\[ x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\]\nThis means that \\( x \\) can be written as:\n\\[ x = 8k + 5 \\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\). The total number of coins before finding the bag of 53 coins is \\( 7x = 7(8k + 5) = 56k + 35 \\). After finding the bag of 53 coins, the total number of coins is:\n\\[ 7x + 53 = 56k + 35 + 53 = 56k + 88 \\]\nWe need this total to be more than 200:\n\\[ 56k + 88 > 200 \\]\n\\[ 56k > 112 \\]\n\\[ k > 2 \\]\nThe smallest integer \\( k \\) that satisfies this inequality is \\( k = 3 \\). Substituting \\( k = 3 \\) into the expression for the total number of coins, we get:\n\\[ 56 \\cdot 3 + 88 = 168 + 88 = 256 \\]\nTherefore, the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins is:\n\\[ 56 \\cdot 3 + 35 = 168 + 35 = 203 \\]\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{203} \\]"
