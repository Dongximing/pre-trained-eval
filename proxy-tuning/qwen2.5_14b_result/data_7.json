      "To find the angle between the two lines given by the equations \\(2x = 3y = -z\\) and \\(6x = -y = -4z\\), we first need to determine the direction vectors of these lines.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the direction vector of the first line\nThe equation \\(2x = 3y = -z\\) can be parameterized by setting \\(2x = 3y = -z = t\\). This gives us:\n\\[x = \\frac{t}{2}, \\quad y = \\frac{t}{3}, \\quad z = -t.\\]\nThus, the direction vector of the first line is:\n\\[\\mathbf{d_1} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, -1 \\right).\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the direction vector of the second line\nThe equation \\(6x = -y = -4z\\) can be parameterized by setting \\(6x = -y = -4z = s\\). This gives us:\n\\[x = \\frac{s}{6}, \\quad y = -s, \\quad z = -\\frac{s}{4}.\\]\nThus, the direction vector of the second line is:\n\\[\\mathbf{d_2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\\frac{1}{4} \\right).\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the dot product of the direction vectors\nThe dot product \\(\\mathbf{d_1} \\cdot \\mathbf{d_2}\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{d_1} \\cdot \\mathbf{d_2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) (-1) + (-1) \\left( -\\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\]\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 12:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1 - 4 + 3}{12} = \\frac{0}{12} = 0.\n\\]\nSince the dot product is zero, the direction vectors are orthogonal, and the angle between the lines is \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle between the two lines is \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."
