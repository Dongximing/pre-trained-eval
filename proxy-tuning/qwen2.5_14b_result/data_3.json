      "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 196:**\n   - First, check if 196 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n     So, 196 is divisible by 2. We can write:\n     \\[\n     196 = 2 \\times 98\n     \\]\n   - Next, check if 98 is divisible by 2.\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, 98 is divisible by 2. We can write:\n     \\[\n     98 = 2 \\times 49\n     \\]\n     Therefore:\n     \\[\n     196 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 49\n     \\]\n   - Now, check if 49 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 49 is not divisible by 3, we move to the next prime number, which is 5. Since 49 is not divisible by 5, we move to the next prime number, which is 7.\n     \\[\n     49 \\div 7 = 7\n     \\]\n     So, 49 is divisible by 7. We can write:\n     \\[\n     49 = 7 \\times 7\n     \\]\n     Therefore:\n     \\[\n     196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Using the Prime Factorization to Find the Number of Divisors:**\n   - The prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n   - To find the number of divisors, we use the formula for the number of divisors of a number based on its prime factorization. If a number \\(n\\) has a prime factorization of \\(p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\cdots \\times p_k^{e_k}\\), then the number of divisors of \\(n\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n     \\]\n   - For \\(196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\\), the exponents are 2 and 2. Therefore, the number of divisors is:\n     \\[\n     (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."
