      "What is $1^{(2^{235423523})}$?"
    ],
    "answer": "1",
    "output": [
      "To solve the expression \\(1^{(2^{235423523})}\\), we need to understand the properties of exponents, particularly when the base is 1.\n\nStep 1: Identify the base and the exponent.\nThe base is 1, and the exponent is \\(2^{235423523}\\).\n\nStep 2: Recall the property of exponents with base 1.\nFor any exponent \\(n\\), \\(1^n = 1\\). This is because multiplying 1 by itself any number of times still results in 1.\n\nStep 3: Apply the property to our specific case.\nSince the base is 1, regardless of the value of the exponent \\(2^{235423523}\\), the result will always be 1.\n\nTherefore, \\(1^{(2^{235423523})} = 1\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."
