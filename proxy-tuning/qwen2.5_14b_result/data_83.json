      "To solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we will follow a step-by-step approach.\n\n1. **Rewrite the equation:**\n   \\[\n   3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate the exponential terms:**\n   \\[\n   3^{2x} = 10^x - 19\n   \\]\n\n3. **Consider the behavior of the functions involved:**\n   - \\(3^{2x}\\) is an exponential function with base 3, which grows very quickly.\n   - \\(10^x\\) is an exponential function with base 10, which also grows very quickly.\n   - The constant term 19 is a fixed value.\n\n4. **Estimate the value of \\(x\\):**\n   - For small values of \\(x\\), \\(10^x\\) is close to 1, and \\(3^{2x}\\) is also close to 1. However, \\(10^x - 19\\) would be negative, which is not possible since \\(3^{2x}\\) is always positive.\n   - For large values of \\(x\\), \\(10^x\\) grows much faster than \\(3^{2x}\\), making \\(10^x - 19\\) much larger than \\(3^{2x}\\).\n\n5. **Test specific values of \\(x\\):**\n   - Let's test \\(x = 2\\):\n     \\[\n     3^{2 \\cdot 2} + 19 = 10^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^4 + 19 = 100\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     81 + 19 = 100\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     100 = 100\n     \\]\n     This is true, so \\(x = 2\\) is a solution.\n\n6. **Verify if there are other solutions:**\n   - Since both \\(3^{2x}\\) and \\(10^x\\) are strictly increasing functions, and the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\) is a transcendental equation, it typically has at most one solution.\n   - We have found that \\(x = 2\\) satisfies the equation, and given the nature of the functions involved, it is unlikely that there are other solutions.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
