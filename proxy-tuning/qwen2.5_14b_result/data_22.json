      "Denali and Nate work for a dog walking business and are paid for each dog they walk. Denali is responsible for $16$ dogs and Nate is responsible for $12$ dogs. Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali. Find $x$ if $x\\neq0$."

      "To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the given conditions and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and the initial conditions:\n- Denali is responsible for \\( 16 \\) dogs.\n- Nate is responsible for \\( 12 \\) dogs.\n- The new policy assigns or unassigns dogs in groups of \\( x \\) dogs.\n\nWe need to find \\( x \\) such that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same under two different scenarios:\n1. Denali starts walking \\( 4x \\) more dogs, and Nate stays at \\( 12 \\) dogs.\n2. \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n\n### Scenario 1: Denali starts walking \\( 4x \\) more dogs\n- Denali's new number of dogs: \\( 16 + 4x \\)\n- Nate's number of dogs: \\( 12 \\)\n\nThe ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay in this scenario is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12}\n\\]\n\n### Scenario 2: \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali\n- Denali's new number of dogs: \\( 16 + x \\)\n- Nate's new number of dogs: \\( 12 - x \\)\n\nThe ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay in this scenario is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, these two ratios must be equal:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nTo solve this equation, we cross-multiply:\n\\[\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\\[\n192 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x\n\\]\n\nSimplify and combine like terms:\n\\[\n192 + 32x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x\n\\]\n\nSubtract 192 from both sides:\n\\[\n32x - 4x^2 = 12x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 12x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n20x - 4x^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\( 4x \\):\n\\[\n4x(5 - x) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\\[\n4x = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 5 - x = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\neq 0 \\), we have:\n\\[\n5 - x = 0 \\implies x = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
