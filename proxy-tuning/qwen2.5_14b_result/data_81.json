    "answer": "3",
    "output": [
      "Let's define the weights of the treeks, squigs, and goolees as \\( T \\), \\( S \\), and \\( G \\) respectively. We are given two equations based on the problem statement:\n\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee:\n\\[ 10T = 3S + G \\]\n\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:\n\\[ 2T + G = S \\]\n\nWe need to find the combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig, i.e., we need to find the value of \\( k \\) such that \\( kT = S \\).\n\nFirst, let's solve the second equation for \\( G \\):\n\\[ G = S - 2T \\]\n\nNext, substitute \\( G = S - 2T \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ 10T = 3S + (S - 2T) \\]\n\\[ 10T = 3S + S - 2T \\]\n\\[ 10T = 4S - 2T \\]\n\\[ 12T = 4S \\]\n\\[ 3T = S \\]\n\nThus, the combined weight of 3 treeks equals the weight of one squig. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"
