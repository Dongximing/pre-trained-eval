      "To solve the equation \\(\\log(kx) = 2\\log(x+2)\\) for integer values of \\(k\\) in the interval \\([-500, 500]\\) such that the equation has exactly one real solution, we start by simplifying the equation using properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the equation:\n\\[\n\\log(kx) = 2\\log(x+2)\n\\]\nUsing the property of logarithms that \\(a\\log(b) = \\log(b^a)\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\log(kx) = \\log((x+2)^2)\n\\]\nSince the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments:\n\\[\nkx = (x+2)^2\n\\]\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\\[\nkx = x^2 + 4x + 4\n\\]\nRearranging terms to form a quadratic equation, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0\n\\]\nFor this quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) of the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\). Here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 4-k\\), and \\(c = 4\\), so the discriminant is:\n\\[\n\\Delta = (4-k)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4 = (4-k)^2 - 16\n\\]\nSetting the discriminant to zero, we get:\n\\[\n(4-k)^2 - 16 = 0\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n(4-k)^2 = 16\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\\[\n4-k = 4 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 4-k = -4\n\\]\nSolving these equations, we find:\n\\[\nk = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad k = 8\n\\]\nWe need to check if these values of \\(k\\) give exactly one real solution to the original equation. For \\(k = 0\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[\n0 \\cdot x = (x+2)^2 \\implies 0 = (x+2)^2\n\\]\nThis has the solution \\(x = -2\\), which is valid since \\(\\log(0 \\cdot (-2))\\) is not defined, but the equation \\((x+2)^2 = 0\\) is satisfied. For \\(k = 8\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[\n8x = (x+2)^2 \\implies x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \\implies (x-2)^2 = 0\n\\]\nThis has the solution \\(x = 2\\), which is valid since \\(\\log(8 \\cdot 2) = \\log(16)\\) and \\(2\\log(4) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4\\), and \\(\\log(16) = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the values of \\(k\\) that satisfy the condition are \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = 8\\). Since these values are within the interval \\([-500, 500]\\), the number of such integer values is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
