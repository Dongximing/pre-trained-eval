    "output": [
      "To solve the problem of seating 8 people around a round table with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single \"block\":**\n   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single unit or \"block\". This reduces the problem to seating 6 units (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.\n\n2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table:**\n   For a round table, the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) units is \\((n-1)!\\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange them is:\n   \\[\n   (6-1)! = 5! = 120\n   \\]\n\n3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block:**\n   Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \\(3!\\) ways. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange them is:\n   \\[\n   3! = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the two results:**\n   To find the total number of ways to seat the 8 people with the given condition, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block:\n   \\[\n   120 \\times 6 = 720\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ways to seat the 8 people around the table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is \\(\\boxed{720}\\)."
