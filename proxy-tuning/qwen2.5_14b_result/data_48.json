      "To determine what power of 4 is equal to 8, we need to express both 4 and 8 as powers of 2, and then solve for the exponent.\n\nFirst, let's express 4 and 8 as powers of 2:\n\\[ 4 = 2^2 \\]\n\\[ 8 = 2^3 \\]\n\nWe want to find a power of 4 that equals 8. Let's denote this power by \\( x \\). Therefore, we need to solve the equation:\n\\[ 4^x = 8 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for 4 and 8 in terms of powers of 2, we get:\n\\[ (2^2)^x = 2^3 \\]\n\nUsing the property of exponents \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\), we can simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 2^{2x} = 2^3 \\]\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[ 2x = 3 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the power of 4 that is equal to 8 is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\). The final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \\]"
