      "To determine the domain of the function \\(\\log x^2\\), we need to ensure that the argument of the logarithm, \\(x^2\\), is positive. The logarithm function \\(\\log y\\) is defined for \\(y > 0\\). Therefore, we need \\(x^2 > 0\\).\n\nLet's analyze the inequality \\(x^2 > 0\\):\n- \\(x^2\\) is always non-negative, i.e., \\(x^2 \\geq 0\\).\n- The only value for which \\(x^2 = 0\\) is \\(x = 0\\).\n- For all other values of \\(x\\), \\(x^2 > 0\\).\n\nThus, \\(x^2 > 0\\) for all \\(x \\neq 0\\). This means the domain of \\(\\log x^2\\) is all real numbers except \\(x = 0\\).\n\nWe can express this domain in the form given in the problem: \\(x < a\\) or \\(x > b\\). Here, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the points where the function is not defined, which is \\(x = 0\\). Therefore, we can set \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 0\\).\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the domain is \\(x < a\\) or \\(x > b\\), which means \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the boundary points that exclude \\(x = 0\\). Since \\(x = 0\\) is the only point excluded, we can set \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 0\\), but the domain is actually all real numbers except \\(x = 0\\), which can be written as \\(x < 0\\) or \\(x > 0\\). Therefore, \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 0\\) are the boundary points, but the domain is split into two parts.\n\nThus, \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 0\\), and the sum \\(a + b = 0 + 0 = 0\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."
