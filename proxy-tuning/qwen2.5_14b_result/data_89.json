      "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers 3339, 2961, and 1491, we will use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nFirst, we find the GCD of 3339 and 2961.\n\n1. **Apply the Euclidean algorithm to 3339 and 2961:**\n   \\[\n   3339 = 2961 \\cdot 1 + 378\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 378.\n\n2. **Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 2961 and 378:**\n   \\[\n   2961 = 378 \\cdot 7 + 279\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 279.\n\n3. **Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 378 and 279:**\n   \\[\n   378 = 279 \\cdot 1 + 99\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 99.\n\n4. **Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 279 and 99:**\n   \\[\n   279 = 99 \\cdot 2 + 81\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 81.\n\n5. **Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 99 and 81:**\n   \\[\n   99 = 81 \\cdot 1 + 18\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 18.\n\n6. **Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 81 and 18:**\n   \\[\n   81 = 18 \\cdot 4 + 9\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 9.\n\n7. **Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 18 and 9:**\n   \\[\n   18 = 9 \\cdot 2 + 0\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 0.\n\nThus, the GCD of 3339 and 2961 is 9.\n\nNext, we find the GCD of 9 and 1491.\n\n1. **Apply the Euclidean algorithm to 1491 and 9:**\n   \\[\n   1491 = 9 \\cdot 165 + 6\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 6.\n\n2. **Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 9 and 6:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 6 \\cdot 1 + 3\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 3.\n\n3. **Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 6 and 3:**\n   \\[\n   6 = 3 \\cdot 2 + 0\n   \\]\n   So, the remainder is 0.\n\nThus, the GCD of 9 and 1491 is 3.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of 3339, 2961, and 1491 is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."
