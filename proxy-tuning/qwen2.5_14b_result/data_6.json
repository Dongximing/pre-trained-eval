      "To find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers, we start by expressing the sum of three consecutive integers in a general form. Let the three consecutive integers be \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\). The sum of these integers is:\n\\[\n(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n\n\\]\nWe need to find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written in the form \\( 3n \\). Let's denote this perfect cube by \\( k^3 \\). Therefore, we need to solve the equation:\n\\[\nk^3 = 3n\n\\]\nThis implies that \\( k^3 \\) must be divisible by 3. Since 3 is a prime number, \\( k \\) itself must be divisible by 3. Let \\( k = 3m \\) for some integer \\( m \\). Then:\n\\[\nk^3 = (3m)^3 = 27m^3\n\\]\nSo, the smallest positive perfect cube that is a multiple of 3 is \\( 27 \\) (when \\( m = 1 \\)). We need to check if 27 can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers. We have:\n\\[\n27 = 3n \\implies n = \\frac{27}{3} = 9\n\\]\nThe three consecutive integers are \\( 8, 9, \\) and \\( 10 \\), and their sum is:\n\\[\n8 + 9 + 10 = 27\n\\]\nThus, 27 is indeed the sum of three consecutive integers. Therefore, the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}\n\\]"
