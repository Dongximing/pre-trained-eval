      "To find the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2, we need to ensure that the number meets two criteria:\n1. It is a multiple of 30.\n2. It is composed only of the digits 0 and 2.\n\nA number is a multiple of 30 if and only if it is a multiple of both 3 and 10. For a number to be a multiple of 10, it must end in 0. For a number to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's start by considering the smallest possible numbers that end in 0 and are composed only of the digits 0 and 2.\n\n1. The smallest number is 20. The sum of the digits is \\(2 + 0 = 2\\), which is not a multiple of 3.\n2. The next smallest number is 220. The sum of the digits is \\(2 + 2 + 0 = 4\\), which is not a multiple of 3.\n3. The next smallest number is 2220. The sum of the digits is \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6\\), which is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince 2220 meets both criteria (it ends in 0 and the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3), it is the smallest number that is a multiple of 30 and can be written with only the digits 0 and 2.\n\nThus, the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is \\(\\boxed{2220}\\)."
