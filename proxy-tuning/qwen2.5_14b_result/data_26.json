      "To solve the problem of seating 7 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of unrestricted seating arrangements:**\n   Since the table is round, we fix one person in one position to avoid counting rotations as different arrangements. This leaves us with 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining 6 people.\n   \\[\n   6! = 720\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of arrangements where at least two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting next to each other:**\n   We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this.\n\n   - **Case 1: Exactly two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting next to each other.**\n     Treat the pair as a single \"block\". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 \"people\" (5 individuals + 1 block) around the table, which can be done in 5! ways. Within the block, the two people can switch places, so there are 2 ways to arrange the block. There are \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) ways to choose which two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas form the block.\n     \\[\n     5! \\times 2 \\times 3 = 120 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 720\n     \\]\n\n   - **Case 2: All three of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting next to each other.**\n     Treat the three as a single \"block\". This reduces the problem to arranging 5 \"people\" (4 individuals + 1 block) around the table, which can be done in 4! ways. Within the block, the three people can be arranged in 3! ways.\n     \\[\n     4! \\times 3! = 24 \\times 6 = 144\n     \\]\n\n   Using inclusion-exclusion, the number of arrangements where at least two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are sitting next to each other is:\n   \\[\n   720 - 144 = 576\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of valid arrangements:**\n   Subtract the number of invalid arrangements from the total number of arrangements.\n   \\[\n   720 - 576 = 144\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to seat 7 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other is \\(\\boxed{144}\\)."
