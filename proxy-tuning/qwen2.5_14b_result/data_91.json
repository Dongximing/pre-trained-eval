      "Given $f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$, what is the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value?"
    ],
    "answer": "1",
    "output": [
      "To determine the smallest possible integer value for \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} \\) has a real number value, we need to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator are defined and that the denominator is not zero.\n\n1. **Numerator Analysis:**\n   The numerator is \\( \\sqrt{x-1} \\). For the square root to be defined, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative:\n   \\[\n   x - 1 \\geq 0 \\implies x \\geq 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Denominator Analysis:**\n   The denominator is \\( x - 2 \\). For the function to be defined, the denominator must not be zero:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 \\neq 0 \\implies x \\neq 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining Conditions:**\n   We need to find the smallest integer \\( x \\) that satisfies both conditions:\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x \\neq 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Integer:**\n   The smallest integer \\( x \\) that is greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 2 is \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - For \\( x = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     f(1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-1}}{1-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0}}{-1} = \\frac{0}{-1} = 0\n     \\]\n     This is a real number.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible integer value for \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) \\) has a real number value is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."
