      "To find the radius of a sphere whose volume and surface area are numerically equal, we start by recalling the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere. The volume \\( V \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nThe surface area \\( A \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ A = 4 \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nWe are given that the volume and surface area are numerically equal, so we set the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = 4 \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( r \\), we first eliminate the common factor \\( 4 \\pi \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = 4 \\pi r^2 \\implies \\frac{4}{3} r^3 = 4 r^2 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} r^3 = r^2 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( r \\), we multiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ r^3 = 3 r^2 \\]\n\nWe can then divide both sides by \\( r^2 \\) (assuming \\( r \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[ r = 3 \\]\n\nThus, the radius of the sphere is \\( r = 3 \\). To confirm, we can substitute \\( r = 3 \\) back into the formulas for volume and surface area:\n\nThe volume is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot 27 = 36 \\pi \\]\n\nThe surface area is:\n\n\\[ A = 4 \\pi (3)^2 = 4 \\pi \\cdot 9 = 36 \\pi \\]\n\nSince the volume and surface area are both \\( 36 \\pi \\), our solution is correct. Therefore, the length of the radius of the sphere is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
