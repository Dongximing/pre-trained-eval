      "To find the quotient when \\(x^6 - 3\\) is divided by \\(x + 1\\), we can use polynomial long division. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Setup the division**: Write \\(x^6 - 3\\) under the division symbol and \\(x + 1\\) outside.\n\n2. **Divide the leading terms**: Divide the leading term of the dividend \\(x^6\\) by the leading term of the divisor \\(x\\), which gives \\(x^5\\). This is the first term of the quotient.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^6}{x} = x^5\n   \\]\n   Multiply \\(x^5\\) by \\(x + 1\\) to get \\(x^6 + x^5\\). Subtract this from \\(x^6 - 3\\):\n   \\[\n   (x^6 - 3) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 - 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Repeat the process**: Divide the new leading term \\(-x^5\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(-x^4\\). This is the next term of the quotient.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-x^5}{x} = -x^4\n   \\]\n   Multiply \\(-x^4\\) by \\(x + 1\\) to get \\(-x^5 - x^4\\). Subtract this from \\(-x^5 - 3\\):\n   \\[\n   (-x^5 - 3) - (-x^5 - x^4) = x^4 - 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Continue the process**: Divide the new leading term \\(x^4\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x^3\\). This is the next term of the quotient.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^4}{x} = x^3\n   \\]\n   Multiply \\(x^3\\) by \\(x + 1\\) to get \\(x^4 + x^3\\). Subtract this from \\(x^4 - 3\\):\n   \\[\n   (x^4 - 3) - (x^4 + x^3) = -x^3 - 3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Continue the process**: Divide the new leading term \\(-x^3\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(-x^2\\). This is the next term of the quotient.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-x^3}{x} = -x^2\n   \\]\n   Multiply \\(-x^2\\) by \\(x + 1\\) to get \\(-x^3 - x^2\\). Subtract this from \\(-x^3 - 3\\):\n   \\[\n   (-x^3 - 3) - (-x^3 - x^2) = x^2 - 3\n   \\]\n\n6. **Continue the process**: Divide the new leading term \\(x^2\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x\\). This is the next term of the quotient.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2}{x} = x\n   \\]\n   Multiply \\(x\\) by \\(x + 1\\) to get \\(x^2 + x\\). Subtract this from \\(x^2 - 3\\):\n   \\[\n   (x^2 - 3) - (x^2 + x) = -x - 3\n   \\]\n\n7. **Continue the process**: Divide the new leading term \\(-x\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(-1\\). This is the next term of the quotient.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-x}{x} = -1\n   \\]\n   Multiply \\(-1\\) by \\(x + 1\\) to get \\(-x - 1\\). Subtract this from \\(-x - 3\\):\n   \\[\n   (-x - 3) - (-x - 1) = -2\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final quotient and remainder**: The quotient is \\(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1\\) and the remainder is \\(-2\\).\n\nTherefore, the quotient when \\(x^6 - 3\\) is divided by \\(x + 1\\) is \\(\\boxed{x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1}\\)."
