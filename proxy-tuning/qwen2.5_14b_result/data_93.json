      "To determine the value of \\( c \\) for which the circle with the equation \\( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \\) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\nFirst, we complete the square for the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms.\n\n1. **Complete the square for the \\( x \\)-terms:**\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 10x\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-10\\), divide by 2 to get \\(-5\\), and then square it to get \\(25\\). So, we add and subtract 25:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25\n   \\]\n\n2. **Complete the square for the \\( y \\)-terms:**\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 6y\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \\( y \\), which is \\(6\\), divide by 2 to get \\(3\\), and then square it to get \\(9\\). So, we add and subtract 9:\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9\n   \\]\n\nNow, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:\n\\[\n(x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25) + (y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9) + c = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n(x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\n\\]\nCombine the constants:\n\\[\n(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0\n\\]\nRearrange to isolate the constant term:\n\\[\n(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\n\\]\n\nFor the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must equal \\(1^2 = 1\\):\n\\[\n34 - c = 1\n\\]\nSolve for \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc = 34 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\nc = 33\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( c \\) is \\(\\boxed{33}\\)."
