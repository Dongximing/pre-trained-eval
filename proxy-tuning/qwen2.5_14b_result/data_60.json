      "To determine the ordered triple \\((p, q, r)\\) such that the polynomial \\(x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1\\) is a factor of \\(x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r\\), we start by letting \\(P(x) = x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r\\) and \\(Q(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1\\). Since \\(Q(x)\\) is a factor of \\(P(x)\\), we can write \\(P(x) = Q(x) \\cdot R(x)\\) for some polynomial \\(R(x)\\) of degree 6. Let's assume \\(R(x) = x^6 + ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f\\).\n\nExpanding the product \\(Q(x) \\cdot R(x)\\), we get:\n\\[\n(x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1)(x^6 + ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f).\n\\]\nWe need to match the coefficients of the resulting polynomial with those of \\(x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r\\). Let's expand the product step by step.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^9\\) is \\(1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\), which matches the coefficient of \\(x^9\\) in \\(P(x)\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^8\\) is \\(-3 \\cdot 1 = -3\\), but there is no \\(x^8\\) term in \\(P(x)\\), so the coefficient of \\(x^8\\) must be 0. This implies that the coefficient of \\(x^8\\) in the expansion is \\(-3 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot a = 0\\), so \\(a = 3\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^7\\) is \\(4 \\cdot 1 + (-3) \\cdot 3 = 4 - 9 = -5\\), but there is no \\(x^7\\) term in \\(P(x)\\), so the coefficient of \\(x^7\\) must be 0. This implies that the coefficient of \\(x^7\\) in the expansion is \\(4 \\cdot 1 + (-3) \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot b = 0\\), so \\(b = 5\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^6\\) is \\(-1 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot 3 + (-3) \\cdot 5 = -1 + 12 - 15 = -4\\), but the coefficient of \\(x^6\\) in \\(P(x)\\) is \\(p\\), so \\(p = -4\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^5\\) is \\(1 \\cdot 3 + 4 \\cdot 5 + (-3) \\cdot 5 + 1 \\cdot c = 3 + 20 - 15 + c = 8 + c\\), but there is no \\(x^5\\) term in \\(P(x)\\), so the coefficient of \\(x^5\\) must be 0. This implies that \\(c = -8\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^4\\) is \\(-1 \\cdot 5 + 4 \\cdot 5 + (-3) \\cdot (-8) + 1 \\cdot d = -5 + 20 + 24 + d = 39 + d\\), but there is no \\(x^4\\) term in \\(P(x)\\), so the coefficient of \\(x^4\\) must be 0. This implies that \\(d = -39\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^3\\) is \\(1 \\cdot (-8) + 4 \\cdot (-8) + (-3) \\cdot (-39) + 1 \\cdot e = -8 - 32 + 117 + e = 77 + e\\), but the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in \\(P(x)\\) is \\(q\\), so \\(q = 77\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is \\(-1 \\cdot (-39) + 4 \\cdot (-8) + (-3) \\cdot e + 1 \\cdot f = 39 - 32 - 3e + f = 7 - 3e + f\\), but there is no \\(x^2\\) term in \\(P(x)\\), so the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) must be 0. This implies that \\(f = 3e - 7\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(1 \\cdot e + 4 \\cdot f = e + 4(3e - 7) = e + 12e - 28 = 13e - 28\\), but there is no \\(x\\) term in \\(P(x)\\), so the coefficient of \\(x\\) must be 0. This implies that \\(13e - 28 = 0\\), so \\(e = \\frac{28}{13}\\).\n\nThe constant term is \\(-1 \\cdot f = -f\\), but the constant term in \\(P(x)\\) is \\(r\\), so \\(r = -f = -\\left(3 \\cdot \\frac{28}{13} - 7\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{84}{13} - \\frac{91}{13}\\right) = -\\left(-\\frac{7}{13}\\right) = \\frac{7}{13}\\).\n\nTherefore, the ordered triple \\((p, q, r)\\) is \\(\\boxed{(-4, 77, \\frac{7}{13})}\\)."
