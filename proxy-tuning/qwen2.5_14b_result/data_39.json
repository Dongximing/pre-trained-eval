    "output": [
      "To find the result when the greatest common factor (GCF) of 6432 and 132 is increased by 11, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of 6432:**\n   - 6432 is even, so divide by 2: \\(6432 \\div 2 = 3216\\)\n   - 3216 is even, so divide by 2: \\(3216 \\div 2 = 1608\\)\n   - 1608 is even, so divide by 2: \\(1608 \\div 2 = 804\\)\n   - 804 is even, so divide by 2: \\(804 \\div 2 = 402\\)\n   - 402 is even, so divide by 2: \\(402 \\div 2 = 201\\)\n   - 201 is not even, so check for divisibility by 3: \\(201 \\div 3 = 67\\)\n   - 67 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 6432 is \\(2^5 \\times 3 \\times 67\\).\n\n2. **Find the prime factorization of 132:**\n   - 132 is even, so divide by 2: \\(132 \\div 2 = 66\\)\n   - 66 is even, so divide by 2: \\(66 \\div 2 = 33\\)\n   - 33 is divisible by 3: \\(33 \\div 3 = 11\\)\n   - 11 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 132 is \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 11\\).\n\n3. **Determine the GCF of 6432 and 132:**\n   - The common prime factors are \\(2^2\\) and \\(3\\).\n   - Therefore, the GCF is \\(2^2 \\times 3 = 4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n\n4. **Increase the GCF by 11:**\n   - \\(12 + 11 = 23\\).\n\nThus, the result when the greatest common factor of 6432 and 132 is increased by 11 is \\(\\boxed{23}\\)."
