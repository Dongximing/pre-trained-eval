      "To solve the equation \\( |5x-1| = x+3 \\), we need to consider the definition of the absolute value function. The expression \\( |5x-1| \\) can be broken into two cases: \\( 5x-1 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( 5x-1 < 0 \\).\n\n**Case 1: \\( 5x-1 \\geq 0 \\)**\nIn this case, \\( |5x-1| = 5x-1 \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[ 5x-1 = x+3 \\]\nSubtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 4x-1 = 3 \\]\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\\[ 4x = 4 \\]\nDivide by 4:\n\\[ x = 1 \\]\nWe need to check if \\( x = 1 \\) satisfies the condition \\( 5x-1 \\geq 0 \\):\n\\[ 5(1) - 1 = 4 \\geq 0 \\]\nSince the condition is satisfied, \\( x = 1 \\) is a valid solution for this case.\n\n**Case 2: \\( 5x-1 < 0 \\)**\nIn this case, \\( |5x-1| = -(5x-1) = -5x+1 \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[ -5x+1 = x+3 \\]\nAdd \\( 5x \\) to both sides:\n\\[ 1 = 6x + 3 \\]\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\\[ -2 = 6x \\]\nDivide by 6:\n\\[ x = -\\frac{1}{3} \\]\nWe need to check if \\( x = -\\frac{1}{3} \\) satisfies the condition \\( 5x-1 < 0 \\):\n\\[ 5\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - 1 = -\\frac{5}{3} - 1 = -\\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{3}{3} = -\\frac{8}{3} < 0 \\]\nSince the condition is satisfied, \\( x = -\\frac{1}{3} \\) is a valid solution for this case.\n\nNow, we compare the two solutions \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -\\frac{1}{3} \\). The largest value is \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the largest value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."
