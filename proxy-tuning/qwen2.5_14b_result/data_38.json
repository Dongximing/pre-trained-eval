      "If a snack-size tin of peaches has $40$ calories and is $2\\%$ of a person's daily caloric requirement, how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement?"
    ],
    "answer": "2000",
    "output": [
      "To determine the total daily caloric requirement, we start by understanding the given information: a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and this amount is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement.\n\nStep 1: Let \\( x \\) represent the total daily caloric requirement.\n\nStep 2: According to the problem, 40 calories is 2% of \\( x \\). We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\\[\n40 = 0.02x\n\\]\n\nStep 3: To find \\( x \\), we need to solve the equation for \\( x \\). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.02:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{40}{0.02}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Perform the division:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{40}{0.02} = \\frac{40}{\\frac{2}{100}} = \\frac{40 \\times 100}{2} = \\frac{4000}{2} = 2000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total daily caloric requirement is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2000}\n\\]"
