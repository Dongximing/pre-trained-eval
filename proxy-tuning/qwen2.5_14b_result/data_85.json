      "To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information and the relationship between the volume of water added and the rise in water level.\n\n1. **Volume of Water Added per Hour:**\n   The tank is being filled with water at a rate of \\(20\\pi\\) cubic meters per hour.\n\n2. **Rise in Water Level per Hour:**\n   The water level rises by 4 meters per hour.\n\n3. **Volume of a Cylindrical Slice:**\n   The volume of water added per hour can also be expressed as the volume of a cylindrical slice with height equal to the rise in water level. The volume \\(V\\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where \\(r\\) is the radius of the base and \\(h\\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\n4. **Relating Volume and Height:**\n   In this problem, the height \\(h\\) of the cylindrical slice is 4 meters. Therefore, the volume of water added per hour can be written as:\n   \\[\n   20\\pi = \\pi r^2 \\cdot 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for the Radius:**\n   To find the radius \\(r\\), we first isolate \\(r^2\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(4\\pi\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20\\pi}{4\\pi} = r^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   5 = r^2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finding the Radius:**\n   Taking the square root of both sides, we find:\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the radius of the tank is \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}\\) meters."
