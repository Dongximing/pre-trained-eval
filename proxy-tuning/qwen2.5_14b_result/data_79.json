    "output": [
      "To find the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the left-hand side of the equation:**\n   \\[\n   2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 8 \\cdot 3^x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the simplified left-hand side equal to the right-hand side:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate \\( 3^x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the right-hand side:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = 9\n   \\]\n\n5. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
