      "If $2^8=4^x$, what is the value of $x$?"
    ],
    "answer": "4",
    "output": [
      "To solve the equation \\(2^8 = 4^x\\), we need to express both sides of the equation with the same base. Let's start by expressing 4 as a power of 2.\n\nWe know that:\n\\[4 = 2^2\\]\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite \\(4^x\\) as:\n\\[4^x = (2^2)^x\\]\n\nUsing the property of exponents \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\), we get:\n\\[(2^2)^x = 2^{2x}\\]\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\\[2^8 = 2^{2x}\\]\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[8 = 2x\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[x = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(x\\) is:\n\\[\\boxed{4}\\]"
